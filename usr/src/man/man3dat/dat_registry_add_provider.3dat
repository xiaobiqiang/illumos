.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The Provider declares itself with the Dynamic Registry. Note that the caller
can choose to register itself multiple times, for example once for each port.
The choice of what to virtualize is up to the Provider. Each registration
provides an Interface Adapter to DAT. Each Provider must have a unique name.
.sp
.LP
The same IA Name cannot be added multiple times. An attempt to register the
same IA Name again results in an error with the return value
\fBDAT_PROVIDER_ALREADY_REGISTERED\fR.
.sp
.LP
The contents of provider_info must be the same as those the Consumer uses in
the call to \fBdat_ia_open\fR(3DAT) directly, or the ones provided indirectly
defined by the header files with which the Consumer compiled.
