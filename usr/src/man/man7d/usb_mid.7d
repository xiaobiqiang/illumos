.SH NAME
usb_mid \- USB Multi Interface Driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBdevice@\fR\fIunit-address\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBusb_mid\fR driver is a \fBUSBA\fR (Solaris Universal Serial Bus
Architecture)-compliant nexus driver that binds to device level nodes of a
composite (multi interface) device if no vendor or class-specific driver is
available. The \fBusb_mid\fR driver creates interface nodes or interface
association nodes and attempts to bind drivers to them. If no driver is found
for interface association nodes, \fBusb_ia\fR(7D) is bound by default.
.SS "UGEN (Generic USB)"
.LP
The \fBusb_mid\fR driver also supports a \fBugen\fR(7D) interface allowing raw
access to the device, for example by libusb applications, by
passing the drivers bound to each interface. Since a libusb application might
change the state of the device, you should not access the device through the
child interface drivers. Note that the \fBusb_mid\fR driver creates a ugen
interface only if none of its children are explicitly bound to the
\fBugen\fR(7D) driver. Additionally, \fBusb_mid\fR does not create children.

In addition to being logged, the following messages may appear on the system
console. All messages are formatted in the following manner:
.sp
.in +2

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBCannot access <device>. Please reconnect.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This device has been disconnected because a device other than the original one
has been inserted. The driver informs you of this fact by displaying the name
of the original device.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBDevice not identical to the previous one on this port. Please disconnect and
reconnect.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Same condition as described above; however in this case, the driver is unable
to identify the original device with a name string.
