.SH NAME
sdt \- DTrace statically defined tracing provider
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBsdt\fR driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that performs dynamic
instrumentation at statically-defined locations in the kernel.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsdt\fR provider allows kernel developers to explicitly create probes at
formally designated locations in the operating system kernel and loadable
modules, allowing the implementor to consciously choose the points in their
code that are desired probe points, and to convey some semantic knowledge about
that point with the choice of probe name and a relevant set of arguments.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsdt\fR driver is not a public interface and you access instrumentation
offered by this provider through DTrace. Refer to the \fIDynamic
Tracing Guide\fR for a description of the public documented interfaces
available for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the \fBsdt\fR
provider.
