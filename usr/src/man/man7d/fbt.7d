.SH NAME
fbt \- DTrace function boundary tracing provider
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBfbt\fR driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that performs dynamic
instrumentation at function boundaries in the kernel.
.sp
.LP
The function is the fundamental unit of program text. In a well-designed
system, the function performs a discrete and well-defined operation on a
specified object or series of like objects. Most functions are implemented by
themselves calling functions on encapsulated objects, but some functions
\(emso-called "leaf functions" \(em are implemented without making further
function calls. The Function Boundary Tracing \fBfbt\fR provider contains a
mechanism for instrumenting the vast majority of functions in the kernel and
offering the instrumentation as a set of DTrace probes.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfbt\fR driver is not a public interface and you access the
instrumentation offered by this provider through DTrace. Refer to the
\fIDynamic Tracing Guide\fR for a description of the public documented
interfaces available for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the
\fBfbt\fR provider.
