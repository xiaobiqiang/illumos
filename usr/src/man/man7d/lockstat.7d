.TH LOCKSTAT 7D "Dec 10, 2017"
.SH NAME
lockstat \- DTrace kernel lock instrumentation provider
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlockstat\fR driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that performs
dynamic instrumentation for locking primitives in the kernel.
.sp
.LP
The \fBlockstat\fR provider makes probes available that you can use to discern
lock contention statistics, or to understand virtually any aspect of locking
behavior inside the operating system kernel. The \fBlockstat\fR(1M) command is
implemented as a DTrace consumer that uses the lockstat provider to gather raw
data.
.sp
.LP
The \fBlockstat\fR driver is not a public interface and you access the
instrumentation offered by this provider through DTrace. Refer to the
\fIDynamic Tracing Guide\fR for a description of the public documented
interfaces available for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the
\fBlockstat\fR provider.
