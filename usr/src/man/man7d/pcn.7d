\fBpcn\fR \- PCnet Ethernet device driver
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
.LP
The \fBpcn\fR driver is a multi\-threaded, loadable, clonable GLDv3\-based
STREAMS driver supporting the Data Link Provider Interface \fBdlpi\fR(7P) for
the AMD PCnet family of Ethernet controllers\.
.SH "APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE"
The \fBpcn\fR driver can be used as either a "style 1" or a "style 2" Data Link
Service Provider\. Physical points of attachment (PPAs) are interpreted as the
instance number of the \fBpcn\fR controller as assigned by the
operating environment\.
.sp
.LP
The values returned by the driver in the \fBDL_INFO_ACK\fR response are:
.RS +4

SAP length is \-2\. The 6\-byte physical address is immediately followed by a
2\-byte SAP\.

The broadcast address is the 6\-byte Ethernet broadcast address
(\fBff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\fR)\.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
.LP
The \fBpcn\fR driver performs auto-negotiation to select the link speed and
mode\.  Link sped may be 100Mbps full\-duplex, 100Mbps half\-duplex,
10Mbps full\-duplex, or 10Mbps half\-duplex, depending on the hardware
adapter type\.  See the \fIIEEE802.3\fR standard for more information\.
.sp
.LP
The capabilities advertised by the \fBpcn\fR device can be set using
\fBdladm\fR(1m)\.  The driver supports a number of parameters whose names
being with \fBen_\fR (see below)\.  Each of these parameters contains a
boolean value that determines if the devices advertises that mode of
operations\.  The \fBadv_autoneg_cap\fR parameter controls whether
auto-negotioation is performed\.  If \fBadv_autoneg_cap\fR is set to 0, the
driver forces the mode of operation selected by the first non-zero
parameter in priority order as shown below:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
                            (highest priority/greatest throughput)
        en_100fdx_cap           100Mbps full duplex
        en_10fdx_cap            10Mbps full duplex
                         (lowest priority/least throughput)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
All capabilities default to enabled\.  Note that changing any capability
parameter causes te link to go down while the link partners renegotiate
the link speed/duplex using the newly changed capabilities\.
