.Sh NAME
.Nm elxl
.Nd 3Com Etherlink XL device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /dev/elxl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the 3Com Etherlink XL
family of Ethernet and Fast Ethernet PCI controllers.
These are often known by their part numbers, most often 3c905 or 3c900 variants.
.Lp
The 3c905 devices generally support some form of 100 Mbps Ethernet,
whereas the 3c900 devices usually only support 10 Mbps.
Some devices support legacy media such as 10BASE-15, 10BASE-2, and even
10BASE-FL.
.
Where applicable, the devices support auto-negotiation, both full and
half duplex, etc.
They also support full size MTUs (1500 bytes), even when used with VLANs.
.
.Lp
The device driver supports the
.Xr ieee802.3 5
properties, which can be configured with
.Xr dladm 1M .
.Lp
In addition, for devices with multiple external media ports, the driver
supports a driver-specific
.Xr dladm 1M
property called
.Sy media ,
which can take one of the following values, depending on the available
media options on the device:
.Lp
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width Sy
.It Sy mii
Media Indendent Interface (MII), also 100BASE-TX
.It Sy tp-hdx
10 Mbps twisted pair, half-duplex
.It Sy tp-fdx
10 Mbps twisted pair full-duplex
.It Sy fx-hdx
100BASE-FX (fiber), half-duplex
.It Sy fx-hdx
100BASE-FX (fiber), full-duplex
.It Sy bnc
10BASE-2
.Pq BNC, aka Dq thin-net
.It Sy aui
10BASE-15
.Pq aka Dq thick-net
.It Sy fl-hdx
10BASE-FL (fiber), half-duplex
.It Sy fl-fdx
10BASE-FL (fiber), full-duplex
.El
.Lp
The specific media options available can be queried with the
device-specific
.Sy available_media
.Xr dladm 1M
property.
.Sh FILES
