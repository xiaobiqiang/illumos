.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBuhci\fR host controller driver is a \fBUSBA \fR (Solaris USB
Architecture) compliant nexus driver that supports the \fIUniversal Host
Controller Interface Specification 1.1\fR, an industry standard developed by
Intel. The \fBuhci\fR driver supports all USB transfers, including interrupt,
control, isochronous and bulk.
