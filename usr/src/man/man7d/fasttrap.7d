.SH NAME
fasttrap \- DTrace user instruction tracing provider
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBfasttrap\fR driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that performs
dynamic instrumentation of arbitrary instructions in illumos processes. The
\fBfasttrap\fR driver implements the DTrace \fBfasttrap\fR and \fBpid\fR
providers.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfasttrap\fR driver is not a public interface and you access
instrumentation offered by this provider through DTrace. Refer to the
\fIDynamic Tracing Guide\fR for a description of the public documented
interfaces available for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the
\fBfasttrap\fR provider.
.SH SPARC ONLY
.LP
The \fBfasttrap\fR provider provides a DTrace probe that fires each time a user
process executes an instruction. The \fBpid\fR provider allows for the dynamic
creation of DTrace probes corresponding to instruction locations inside any
user process specified using a process ID and an instruction address or symbol
name. Together these providers permit DTrace users to perform instrumentation
of user processes and to trace the interactions between processes and
the operating system. See the chapter entitled "User Process Tracing"  in the
\fIDynamic Tracing Guide\fR for information on how to use these
providers to instrument processes.
