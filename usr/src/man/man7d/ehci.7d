.SH NAME
ehci \- Enhanced host controller driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBusb@unit-address\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBehci\fR driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant nexus
driver that supports the Enhanced Host Controller Interface Specification 2.0,
an industry standard developed by Intel.
.sp
.LP
A USB 2.0 host controller includes one high-speed host controller and zero or
more USB 1.1 host controllers. The high-speed host controller implements an
EHCI (Enhanced Host Controller Interface) that is used for all high-speed
communications to high-speed-mode devices.
.sp
.LP
All USB 2.0 devices connected to the root ports of the USB 2.0 host
controller and all devices connected to a high-speed-mode hub should be routed
to the EHCI host controller.
.sp
.LP
All full- and low-speed devices connected to the root ports of the USB 2.0 host
controller should be routed to the companion USB 1.1 host controllers. (OHCI or
UHCI host controller).
.sp
.LP
The \fBehci\fR supports bulk, interrupt, control and iso chronous transfers
(on USB1.\fIx\fR devices behind a USB2.0 hub).

In addition to being logged, the following messages may appear on the system
console. All messages are formatted in the following manner:

\fBUnrecoverable USB hardware error.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
There was an unrecoverable USB hardware error reported by the \fBehci\fR
controller. Reboot the system. If this problem persists, contact your system
vendor.

The driver failed to clear 2.0 hub's TT buffer. Remove and reinsert the
external USB2.0 hub.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The driver was unable to take control of the EHCI hardware from the system's
BIOS. This failure is ignored. To abort the attach on this take-over failure,
comment out a property in ehci.conf. (x86 only).
.RE

\fBUnable to take control from BIOS.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The driver is unable to take control of the EHCI hardware from the
system's BIOS and aborts the attach. High speed (USB 2.0) support is disabled.
In this case, all USB devices run at full/low speed. Contact your system vendor
or your system administror for possible changes in BIOS settings. You can
disable a property in \fBehci.conf\fR to ignore this failure. (x86 only.)

\fBLow speed device is not supported.\fR
.ad

\fBFull speed device is not supported.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The driver detected a low or full speed device on its root hub port. Per USB
2.0 specification, the device should be routed to a companion host controller
(OHCI or UHCI). However, no attached companion host controller appears to be
available. Therefore, low and full speed devices are not supported.
.RE

.ne 2
.na
\fBLow speed endpoint's poll interval of <n> ms is below threshold. Rounding up
to 8 ms.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Low speed endpoints are limited to polling intervals between 8 ms and 255 ms.
If a device reports a polling interval that is less than 8 ms, the driver uses
8 ms instead.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBLow speed endpoint's poll interval is greater than 255 ms.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The low speed device's polling interval is out of range. The host controller
does not allocate bandwidth for this device. This device is not usable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBFull speed endpoint's poll interval must be between 1 and 255 ms.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The full speed device's polling interval is out of range. The host controller
does not allocate bandwidth for this device. This device is not usable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBHigh speed endpoint's poll interval must be between 1 and 16 units.\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The high speed device's polling interval is out of range. The host controller
will not allocate bandwidth for this device. This device will not be usable.
Refer to the USB specification, revision 2.0 for the unit definition.

Note -
.sp
.RS 2
Due to recently discovered incompatibilities with this USB controller,
USB2.\fIx\fR transfer support has been disabled. However, this device continues
to function as a USB1.\fIx\fR controller. Information on enabling USB2.x
support is provided in this man page.
.LP
VIA chips may not be compatible with this driver. To bind \fBehci\fR
specifically to the chip and eliminate the warnings, and to enable USB2.x
support, a new, more specific driver alias (refer to \fBadd_drv\fR(1M) and
\fBupdate_drv\fR(1M)) must be specified for \fBehci\fR. By default, the
\fBehci\fR alias is 'pciclass,0c0320.' The compatible names in the
\fBprtconf\fR(1M) output provides additional aliases. For example:
.RE
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   # prtconf -vp | grep pciclass,0c0320
        compatible: 'pci1106,3104.1106.3104.2063' +
\&'pci1106,3104.1106.3104' + 'pci1106,3104' +
 pci1106,3104.2063' + 'pci1106,3104' + 'pciclass,0c0320' +
\&'pciclass,0c03'
         ....


       A more specific alias is 'pci1106,3104.' Perform the follow-
       ing step to add this alias, then reboot the system:


       # update_drv -a -i '"pci1106,3104"' ehci

       # reboot
.fi
.in -2

After you apply the above workaround, the following message is displayed in
your system log:
