.TH IMAXDIV 3C "Nov 1, 2003"
.SH NAME
imaxdiv \- return quotient and remainder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <inttypes.h>

\fBimaxdiv_t\fR \fBimaxdiv\fR(\fBimaxdiv_t\fR \fInumer\fR, \fBimaxdiv_t\fR \fIdenom\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBimaxdiv()\fR function computes \fInumer\fR / \fIdenom\fR and \fInumer\fR
% \fIdenom\fR in a single operation.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBimaxdiv()\fR function returns a structure of type \fBimaxdiv_t\fR,
comprising both the quotient and the remainder. The structure contains (in
either order) the members \fBquot\fR (the quotient) and \fBrem\fR (the
remainder), each of which has type \fBintmax_t\fR. If either part of the result
cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined.
.SH ERRORS

.LP
No errors are defined.
