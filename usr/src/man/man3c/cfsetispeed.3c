.TH CFSETISPEED 3C "Jul 24, 2002"
.SH NAME
cfsetispeed, cfsetospeed \- set input and output baud rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBcfsetispeed\fR(\fBstruct termios *\fR\fItermios_p\fR, \fBspeed_t\fR \fIspeed\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBcfsetospeed\fR(\fBstruct termios *\fR\fItermios_p\fR, \fBspeed_t\fR \fIspeed\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfsetispeed()\fR function sets the input baud rate stored in the
structure pointed to by \fItermios_p\fR to \fIspeed.\fR
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfsetospeed()\fR function sets the output baud rate stored in the
structure pointed to by \fItermios_p\fR to \fIspeed.\fR
.sp
.LP
There is no effect on the baud rates set in the hardware until a subsequent
successful call to \fBtcsetattr\fR(3C) on the same \fBtermios\fR structure.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcfsetispeed()\fR and \fBcfsetospeed()\fR return
\fB0\fR. Otherwise \fB\(mi1\fR is returned, and \fBerrno\fR may be set to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBcfsetispeed()\fR and \fBcfsetospeed()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIspeed\fR value is not a valid baud rate.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The value of \fIspeed\fR is outside the range of possible speed values as
specified in \fB<termios.h>\fR\&.
.RE
