.TH SETKEY 3C "Aug 14, 2002"
.SH NAME
setkey \- set encoding key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBsetkey\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIkey\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetkey()\fR function provides (rather primitive) access to the hashing
algorithm employed by the \fBcrypt\fR(3C) function. The argument of
\fBsetkey()\fR is an array of length 64 bytes containing only the bytes with
numerical value of 0 and 1. If this string is divided into groups of 8, the
low-order bit in each group is ignored; this gives a 56-bit key which is used
by the algorithm. This is the key that will be used with the algorithm to
encode a string \fIblock\fR passed to \fBencrypt\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
No values are returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetkey()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The functionality is not supported on this implementation.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
In some environments, decoding may not be implemented.  This is related to U.S.
Government restrictions on encryption and decryption routines: the \fBDES\fR
decryption algorithm cannot be exported outside the U.S.A. Historical practice
has been to ship a different version of the encryption library without the
decryption feature in the routines supplied. Thus the exported version of
\fBencrypt()\fR does encoding but not decoding.
.sp
.LP
Because \fBsetkey()\fR does not return a value, applications wishing to check
for errors should set \fBerrno\fR to 0, call \fBsetkey()\fR, then test
\fBerrno\fR and, if it is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
