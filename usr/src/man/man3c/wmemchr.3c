.TH WMEMCHR 3C "Aug 14, 2002"
.SH NAME
wmemchr \- find a wide-character in memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwchar_t *\fR\fBwmemchr\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SS "ISO C++"
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fBwmemchr\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
#include <cwchar>

\fBwchar_t *std::\fR\fBwmemchr\fR(\fBwchar_t *\fR\fIws\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemchr()\fR function locates the first occurrence of \fIwc\fR in the
initial \fIn\fR wide-characters of the object pointed to be \fIws\fR. This
function is not affected by locale and all \fBwchar_t\fR values are treated
identically.  The null wide-character and \fBwchar_t\fR values not
corresponding to valid  characters are not treated specially.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is 0,  \fIws\fR must be a valid pointer and the function behaves as
if no valid occurrence of \fIwc\fR is found.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemchr()\fR function returns a pointer to the located  wide-character,
or a null pointer if the wide-character does not occur in the object.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
