.TH POSIX_MEMALIGN 3C "Jul 14, 2008"
.SH NAME
posix_memalign \- aligned memory allocation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/mman.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_memalign\fR(\fBvoid **\fR\fImemptr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIalignment\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIsize\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_memalign()\fR function allocates size bytes aligned on a boundary
specified by alignment, and returns a pointer to the allocated memory in
\fImemptr\fR. The value of alignment must be a power of two multiple of
\fBsizeof\fR(\fBvoid *\fR).
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the value pointed to by \fImemptr\fR will be a
multiple of alignment.
.sp
.LP
If the size of the space requested is 0, the value returned in \fImemptr\fR
will be a null pointer.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfree\fR(3C) function will deallocate memory that has previously been
allocated by \fBposix_memalign()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_memalign()\fR returns zero. Otherwise, an
error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_memalign()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The value of the alignment parameter is not a power of two multiple of
\fBsizeof\fR(\fBvoid *\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
There is insufficient memory available with the requested alignment.
