.TH WCWIDTH 3C "Jun 25, 2014"
.SH NAME
wcwidth, wcwidth_l \- number of column positions of a wide-character code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwcwidth\fR(\fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwcwidth_l\fR(\fBwchar_t\fR \fIwc\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBwcwidth()\fR function determines the number of column positions required
for the wide character \fIwc\fR. The value of \fIwc\fR must be a character
representable as a \fBwchar_t\fR, and must be a wide-character code
corresponding to a valid character in the current locale.
.LP
The function \fBwcwidth_l()\fR behaves identically to \fBwcwidth()\fR, except
instead of operating in the current locale, it operates in the locale
specified by \fIloc\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
These functions either return \fB0\fR (if \fIwc\fR is a null
wide-character code), or the number of column positions to be occupied
by the wide-character code \fIwc\fR, or \fB\(mi1\fR (if \fIwc\fR does
not correspond to a printing wide-character code).
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.LP
See \fBattributes\fR(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:
