.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <libgen.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBbasename\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fIpath\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBbasename()\fR function takes the pathname pointed to by \fIpath\fR and
returns a pointer to the final component of the pathname, deleting any
trailing '/' characters.
.sp
.LP
If the string consists entirely of the '/' character, \fBbasename()\fR returns
a pointer to the string "/" .
.sp
.LP
If \fIpath\fR is a null pointer or points to an empty string, \fBbasename()\fR
returns a pointer to the string "." .
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBbasename()\fR function returns a pointer to the final component of
\fIpath\fR.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBbasename()\fR function may modify the string pointed to by \fIpath\fR,
and may return a pointer to static storage that may then be overwritten by a
subsequent call to \fBbasename()\fR.
.sp
.LP
When compiling multithreaded applications, the \fB_REENTRANT\fR flag must be
defined on the compile line.  This flag should only be used in multithreaded
applications.
