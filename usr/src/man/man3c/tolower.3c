.TH TOLOWER 3C "Oct 4, 2015"
.SH NAME
tolower, tolower_l \- transliterate upper-case characters to lower-case
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <ctype.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtolower\fR(\fBint\fR \fIc\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBtolower_l\fR(\fBint\fR \fIc\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBtolower()\fR function has as a domain of type \fBint\fR, the value of
which is representable as an \fBunsigned char\fR or the value of \fBEOF\fR. If
the argument has any other value, the argument is returned unchanged. If the
argument of \fBtolower()\fR represents an upper-case letter, and there exists a
corresponding lower-case letter (as defined by character type information in
the locale category \fB\fR\fBLC_CTYPE\fR\fB), \fR the result is the
corresponding lower-case letter. All other arguments in the domain are returned
unchanged.
.LP
The function \fBtolower_l()\fR behaves identically to \fBtolower()\fR, except
instead of operating in the current locale, it operates in the locale
specified by \fIloc\fR.
.LP
A macro form, \fB_tolower()\fR exists. It is defined for standards
conformance, particularly with legacy standards. It was deprecated in
POSIX 2008 (Issue 7), and its use is discouraged. The macro, on this
system, is just an alias for \fBtolower()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
On successful completion, \fBtolower()\fR returns the lower-case letter
corresponding to the argument passed. Otherwise, it returns the argument
unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
