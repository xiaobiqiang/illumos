.TH TCFLUSH 3C "Aug 14, 2002"
.SH NAME
tcflush \- flush non-transmitted output data, non-read input data or both
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcflush\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIqueue_selector\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBtcflush()\fR discards data written to the object
referred to by \fIfildes\fR (an open file descriptor associated with a
terminal) but not transmitted, or data received but not read, depending on the
value of \fIqueue_selector\fR:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIqueue_selector\fR is \fBTCIFLUSH\fR it flushes data received but not
read.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIqueue_selector\fR is \fBTCOFLUSH\fR it flushes data written but not
transmitted.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If \fIqueue_selector\fR is \fBTCIOFLUSH\fR it flushes both data received but
not read and data written but not transmitted.
.RE
.sp
.LP
Attempts to use \fBtcflush()\fR from a process which is a member of a
background process group on a \fIfildes\fR associated with its controlling
terminal, will cause the process group to be sent a \fBSIGTTOU\fR signal. If
the calling process is blocking or ignoring \fBSIGTTOU\fR signals, the process
is allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflush()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIqueue_selector\fR argument is not a supported value.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBtcflush()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing process
is not ignoring or blocking \fBSIGTTOU\fR.
