.TH GETPASS 3C "Sep 2, 2003"
.SH NAME
getpass, getpassphrase \- read a string of characters without echo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBgetpass\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIprompt\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBchar *\fR\fBgetpassphrase\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIprompt\fR);
.fi

.SS "XPG4, SUS, SUSv2"
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBgetpass\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIprompt\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpass()\fR function opens the process's controlling terminal, writes
to that device the null-terminated string \fIprompt\fR, disables echoing, reads
a string of characters up to the next newline character or EOF, restores the
terminal state and closes the terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpassphrase()\fR function is identical to \fBgetpass()\fR, except that
it reads and returns a string of up to 257 characters in length.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBgetpass()\fR returns a pointer to a
null-terminated string of at most 9 bytes that were read from the terminal
device. If an error is encountered, the terminal state is restored and a null
pointer is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetpass()\fR and  \fBgetpassphrase()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The function was interrupted by a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The process is a member of a background process attempting to read from its
controlling terminal, the process is ignoring or blocking the \fBSIGTTIN\fR
signal or the process group is orphaned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEMFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fBOPEN_MAX\fR file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENXIO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The process does not have a controlling terminal.
.RE

.SH USAGE
