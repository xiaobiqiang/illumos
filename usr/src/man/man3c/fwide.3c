.SH NAME
fwide \- set stream orientation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfwide\fR(\fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR, \fBint\fR \fImode\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBfwide()\fR function determines the orientation of the stream pointed to
by \fIstream\fR. If \fImode\fR is greater than 0, the function first attempts
to make the stream wide-oriented.  If \fImode\fR is less than 0, the function
first attempts to make the stream byte-oriented.  Otherwise, \fImode\fR is 0
and the function does not alter the orientation of the stream.
.sp
.LP
If the orientation of the stream has already been determined, \fBfwide()\fR
does not change it.
.sp
.LP
Because no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application
wishing to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to 0, then call
\fBfwide()\fR, then check \fBerrno\fR and if it is non-zero, assume an error
has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
The \fBfwide()\fR function returns a value greater than 0 if, after the call,
the stream has wide-orientation, a value less than 0 if the stream has
byte-orientation, or 0 if the stream has no orientation.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fBfwide()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The \fIstream\fR argument is not a valid stream.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.LP
A call to \fBfwide()\fR with  \fImode\fR set to 0 can be used to determine the
current orientation of a stream.
