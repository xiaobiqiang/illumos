.SH NAME
posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy, posix_spawn_file_actions_init \- destroy and
initialize spawn file actions object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy\fR(
     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fR\fIfile_actions\fR);

     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fR\fIfile_actions\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()\fR function destroys the object
referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR. The object becomes, in effect, uninitialized.
An implementation can cause \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()\fR to set the
object referenced by file_actions to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file
actions object can be reinitialized using
\fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR. The results of otherwise referencing the
object after it has been destroyed are undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR function initializes the object
referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR to contain no file actions for
\fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) or \fBposix_spawnp\fR(3C) to perform.
.sp
.LP
A spawn file actions object is as defined in
\fBposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file actions object is
undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error
number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_init()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file actions object.
