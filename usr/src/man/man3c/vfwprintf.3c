.TH VFWPRINTF 3C "Nov 1, 2003"
.SH NAME
vfwprintf, vswprintf, vwprintf \- wide-character formatted output of a stdarg
argument list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBvfwprintf\fR(\fBFILE *restrict\fR \fIstream\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIformat\fR,
     \fBva_list\fR \fIarg\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBvswprintf\fR(\fBwchar_t *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR,
     \fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIformat\fR, \fBva_list\fR \fIarg\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBvwprintf\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIformat\fR, \fBva_list\fR \fIarg\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBvwprintf()\fR, \fBvfwprintf()\fR, and \fBvswprintf()\fR functions are
the same as \fBwprintf()\fR, \fBfwprintf()\fR, and \fBswprintf()\fR
respectively, except that instead of being called with a variable number of
arguments, they are called with an argument list as defined by
<\fBstdarg.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
These functions do not invoke the  \fBva_end()\fR macro.  However, as these
functions do invoke the \fBva_arg()\fR macro, the value of \fIap\fR after the
return is indeterminate.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Refer to  \fBfwprintf\fR(3C).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to  \fBfwprintf\fR(3C).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Applications using these functions should call \fBva_end(\fR\fIap\fR\fB)\fR
afterwards to clean up.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.sp
.LP
See \fBattributes\fR(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

\fBstandards\fR(5)
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBvwprintf()\fR, \fBvfwprintf()\fR, and \fBvswprintf()\fR functions can be
used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as \fBsetlocale\fR(3C) is
not being called to change the locale.
