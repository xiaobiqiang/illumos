.TH GETWC 3C "Jul 11, 2014"
.SH NAME
getwc, getwc_l \- get wide character from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBgetwc\fR(\fBFILE\fR \fI*stream\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBgetwc_l\fR(\fBFILE\fR \fI*stream\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetwc()\fR function is equivalent to \fBfgetwc\fR(3C), except that if it
is implemented as a macro it may evaluate \fIstream\fR more than once, so the
argument should never be an expression with side effects.
.LP
The \fBgetwc_l()\fR function is similar to \fBgetwc()\fR, except instead of
acting on the current locale, it uses the locale specified by \fIloc\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Refer to \fBfgetwc\fR(3C).
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fBfgetwc\fR(3C).
.SH USAGE
.LP
This interface is provided to align with some current implementations and with
possible future \fBISO\fR standards.
.LP
Because they may be implemented as macros, these functions may treat incorrectly
a \fIstream\fR argument with side effects.  In particular,
\fBgetwc\fR(*\fIf\fR\|++) may not work as expected.  Therefore, use of these
functions is not recommended; \fBfgetwc\fR(3C) and \fBfgetwc_l\fR(3C)
should be used instead.
