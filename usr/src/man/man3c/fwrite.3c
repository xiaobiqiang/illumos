.TH FWRITE 3C "Jul 24, 2002"
.SH NAME
fwrite \- binary output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBsize_t\fR \fBfwrite\fR(\fBconst void *\fR\fIptr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIsize\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fInitems\fR, \fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwrite()\fR function writes, from the array pointed to by \fIptr\fR, up
to \fInitems\fR elements whose size is specified by \fIsize\fR, to the stream
pointed to by \fIstream\fR. For each object, \fIsize\fR calls are made to the
\fBfputc\fR(3C) function, taking the values (in order) from an array of
\fBunsigned char\fR exactly overlaying the object. The file-position indicator
for the stream (if defined) is advanced by the number of bytes successfully
written. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position indicator
for the stream is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
The \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the file will be marked for
update between the successful execution of \fBfwrite()\fR and the next
successful completion of a call to \fBfflush\fR(3C) or \fBfclose\fR(3C) on the
same stream or a call to \fBexit\fR(2) or \fBabort\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBfwrite()\fR function returns the number of elements successfully
written, which might be less than \fInitems\fR if a write error is encountered.
If \fIsize\fR or \fInitems\fR is 0, \fBfwrite()\fR returns 0 and the state of
the stream remains unchanged. Otherwise, if a write error occurs, the error
indicator for the stream is set and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfputc\fR(3C).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
Because of possible differences in element length and byte ordering, files
written using \fBfwrite()\fR are application-dependent, and possibly cannot be
read using \fBfread\fR(3C) by a different application or by the same
application on a different processor.
