.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcpcpy
and
.Fn wcpncpy
functions copy the wide-character string pointed to by
.Fa ws2
into the location pointed to by
.Fa ws1 .
They stop copying after a null wide-character is copied, or in the case
of
.Fn wcpncpy ,
after
.Fa n
wide-characters have been copied.
If
.Fa ws2
contains fewer than
.Fa n
wide-characters, then the
.Fn wcpncpy
function pads wide-characters to the end of the destination
.Fa ws1
until exactly
.Fa n
wide-characters have been written.
.Lp
In the case of
.Fn wcpncpy
a terminating null wide-character will
.Em not
be written if the length of
.Fa ws2
exceeds
.Fa n .
.Lp
If
.Fa ws1
and
.Fa ws2
overlap, the result is undefined.
.Lp
The
.Fn wcpcpy
and
.Fn wcpncpy
functions are the wide-character equivalents of
.Fn stpcpy
and
.Fn stpncpy ,
respectively.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcpcpy
and
.Fn wcpncpy
functions return a pointer to the last wide-character written.
In the case of
.Fn wcpncpy
this will always be equal to
.Po Fa ws1 Li + Fa n Li \(mi 1 Pc .
.Sh ERRORS
None.
