.SH NAME
fgetwc, fgetwc_l \- get a wide-character code from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBfgetwc\fR(\fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBwint_t\fR \fBfgetwc_l\fR(\fBFILE *\fR\fIstream\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR, \fIloc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR and \fBfgetwc_l()\fR functions obtain the next
character (if present) from the input stream pointed to by \fIstream\fR,
convert that to the corresponding wide-character code and advance the
associated file position indicator for the stream (if defined).
Whereas \fBfgetwc()\fR uses the current locale, \fBfgetwc_l()\fR uses the
locale specified by \fIloc\fR.
.LP
If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the
stream is indeterminate.
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR and \fBfgetwc_l()\fR functions may mark the \fBst_atime\fR
field of the file
associated with \fIstream\fR for update. The \fBst_atime\fR field will be
marked for update by the first successful execution of \fBfgetwc()\fR,
\fBfgetc\fR(3C), \fBfgets\fR(3C), \fBfgetws\fR(3C), \fBfread\fR(3C),
\fBfscanf\fR(3C), \fBgetc\fR(3C), \fBgetchar\fR(3C), \fBgets\fR(3C), or
\fBscanf\fR(3C) using \fIstream\fR that returns data not supplied by a prior
call to \fBungetc\fR(3C) or \fBungetwc\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Upon successful completion both functions return the
wide-character code of the character read from the input stream pointed to by
\fIstream\fR converted to a type \fBwint_t\fR.
.LP
For standard-conforming (see \fBstandards\fR(5)) applications, if the
end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, \fBfgetwc()\fR and
\fBfgetwc_l()\fR return \fBWEOF\fR whether or not the stream is at
end-of-file.
.LP
If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set,
\fBfgetwc()\fR and \fBfgetwc_l()\fR returns \fBWEOF\fR and sets
\fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.LP
If an encoding error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set,
\fBfgetwc()\fR and \fBfgetwc_l()\fR return \fBWEOF\fR, and \fBerrno\fR is
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR and \fBfgetwc_l()\fR functions will fail if data needs to be
read and:
.TP
.B EAGAIN
The \fBO_NONBLOCK\fR flag is set for the file descriptor underlying
\fIstream\fR and the process would be delayed in the \fBfgetwc()\fR or
\fBfgetwc_l()\fR operation.
.TP
.B EBADF
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fR is not a valid file descriptor open
for reading.
.TP
.B EINTR
The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data
was transferred.
.TP
.B EIO
A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is in a background process
group attempting to read from its controlling terminal and either the process
is ignoring or blocking the \fBSIGTTIN\fR signal or the process group is
orphaned.
.TP
.B EOVERFLOW
The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to read at or beyond the
offset maximum associated with the corresponding  \fIstream\fR.
.LP
The \fBfgetwc()\fR and \fBfgetwc_l()\fR functions may fail if:
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory is available.
.TP
.B ENXIO
A request was made of a non-existent device, or the request was outside the
capabilities of the device.
.TP
.B EILSEQ
The data obtained from the input stream does not form a valid character.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBferror\fR(3C) or \fBfeof\fR(3C) functions must be used to distinguish
between an error condition and an end-of-file condition.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
