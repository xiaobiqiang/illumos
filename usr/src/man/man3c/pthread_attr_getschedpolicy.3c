.TH PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSCHEDPOLICY 3C "Apr 1, 2008"
.SH NAME
pthread_attr_getschedpolicy, pthread_attr_setschedpolicy \- get or set
schedpolicy attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIpolicy\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR(\fBpthread_attr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR, \fBint\fR \fIpolicy\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The functions \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy()\fR, respectively, set and get the
\fIschedpolicy\fR attribute in the \fIattr\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
Supported values of \fIpolicy\fR include  \fBSCHED_FIFO,\fR \fBSCHED_RR\fR and
\fBSCHED_OTHER,\fR which are defined by the header \fB<sched.h>\fR. When
threads executing with the scheduling policy \fBSCHED_FIFO\fR or
\fBSCHED_RR\fR are waiting on a mutex, they acquire the mutex in priority order
when the mutex is unlocked.
.sp
.LP
See \fBsched.h\fR(3HEAD) for a description of all defined policy values.  Valid
policy values can also be obtained from \fBpthread_getschedparam\fR(3C) and
\fBsched_getscheduler\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy()\fR functions return  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an
error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setschedpolicy()\fR or \fBpthread_attr_getschedpolicy()\fR
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fIattr\fR or \fIpolicy\fR is invalid.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the
specified attributes using \fBpthread_create()\fR. Using these routines does
not affect the current running thread.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
