.SH NAME
wctob, wctob_l \- wide-character to single-byte conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwctob\fR(\fBwint_t\fR \fIc\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwctob_l\fR(\fBwint_t\fR \fIc\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBwctob()\fR function determines whether \fIc\fR corresponds to a member
of the extended character set whose  character representation is a single byte
when in the initial shift state.
.LP
The behavior of \fBwctob()\fR is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the
current locale.  See \fBenviron\fR(5)
.LP
The function \fBwctob_l()\fR behaves identically to \fBwctob()\fR, except
instead of operating in the current locale, it operates in the locale
specified by \fIloc\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
These functions return \fBEOF\fR if \fIc\fR does not correspond to
a character with length one in the initial shift state.  Otherwise, they return
the single-byte representation of that character.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.LP
See \fBattributes\fR(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

The \fBwctob()\fR function is Standard.  The \fBwctob_l()\fR function
is Uncommitted.
