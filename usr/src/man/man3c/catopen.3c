.SH NAME
catopen, catclose \- open/close a message catalog
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <nl_types.h>

\fBnl_catd\fR \fBcatopen\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIname\fR, \fBint\fR \fIoflag\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBcatclose\fR(\fBnl_catd\fR \fIcatd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatopen()\fR function opens a message catalog and returns a message
catalog descriptor. \fIname\fR specifies the name of the message catalog to be
opened. If \fIname\fR contains a "/", then  \fIname\fR specifies a complete
pathname for the message catalog; otherwise, the environment variable
\fBNLSPATH\fR is used and  \fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocale\fR\fB/LC_MESSAGES\fR
must exist. If \fBNLSPATH\fR does not exist in the environment, or if a message
catalog cannot be opened in any of the paths specified by \fBNLSPATH\fR, then
the default path \fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocale\fR\fB/LC_MESSAGES\fR is used.
In the "C" locale,  \fBcatopen()\fR will always succeed without checking the
default search path.
.sp
.LP
The names of message catalogs and their location in the filesystem can vary
from one system to another. Individual applications can choose to name or
locate message catalogs according to their own special needs. A mechanism is
therefore required to specify where the catalog resides.
.sp
.LP
The \fBNLSPATH\fR variable provides both the location of message catalogs, in
the form of a search path, and the naming conventions associated with message
catalog files.  For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
NLSPATH=/nlslib/%L/%N.cat:/nlslib/%N/%L
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The metacharacter \fB%\fR introduces a substitution field, where \fB%L\fR
substitutes the current setting of either the \fBLANG\fR environment variable,
if the value of \fIoflag\fR is  \fB0\fR, or the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category, if
the value of \fIoflag\fR is  \fBNL_CAT_LOCALE\fR, and  \fB%N\fR substitutes the
value of the \fIname\fR parameter passed to \fBcatopen()\fR. Thus, in the above
example, \fBcatopen()\fR will search in  \fB/nlslib/$LANG/\fIname\fR.cat\fR, if
\fIoflag\fR is \fB0\fR, or in \fB/nlslib/{LC_MESSAGES}/\fIname\fR.cat\fR, if
\fIoflag\fR is \fBNL_CAT_LOCALE\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBNLSPATH\fR variable will normally be set up on a system wide basis (in
\fB/etc/profile\fR) and thus makes the location and naming conventions
associated with message catalogs transparent to both programs and users.
.sp
.LP
The full set of metacharacters is:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%N\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
The value of the name parameter passed to \fBcatopen()\fR.
.RE

.sp

The value of \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%l\fR\fR

.RS 6n
The value of the \fIlanguage\fR element of \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
The value of the \fIterritory\fR element of \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
The value of the \fIcodeset\fR element of \fBLANG\fR or \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB%%\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
A single %.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBLANG\fR environment variable provides the ability to specify the user's
requirements for native languages, local customs and character set, as an ASCII
string in the form
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LANG=language[_territory[.codeset]]
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
A user who speaks German as it is spoken in Austria and has a terminal which
operates in ISO 8859/1 codeset, would want the setting of the LANG variable to
be
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LANG=De_A.88591
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
With this setting it should be possible for that user to find any  relevant
catalogs should they exist.
.sp
.LP
Should the \fBLANG\fR variable not be set, the value of \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR as
returned by \fBsetlocale()\fR is used.  If this is \fINULL,\fR the default path
as defined in <\fBnl_types.h\fR> is used.
.sp
.LP
A message catalogue descriptor remains valid in a process until that process
closes it, or a successful call to one of the \fBexec\fR functions. A change in
the setting of the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category may invalidate existing open
catalogues.
.sp
.LP
If a file descriptor is used to implement message catalogue descriptors, the
\fBFD_CLOEXEC\fR flag will be set; see <\fBfcntl.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIoflag\fR argument is \fB0\fR, the  \fBLANG\fR environment
variable is used to locate the catalogue without regard to the
\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category.  If the \fIoflag\fR argument is
\fBNL_CAT_LOCALE\fR, the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category is used to locate the
message catalogue.
.sp
.LP
The \fBcatclose()\fR function closes the message catalog identified by
\fIcatd\fR. If a file descriptor is used to implement the type \fBnl_catd\fR,
that file descriptor will be closed.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcatopen()\fR returns a message catalog
descriptor for use on  subsequent calls to  \fBcatgets()\fR and
\fBcatclose()\fR. Otherwise it returns \fB(nl_catd) \(mi1\fR.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBcatclose()\fR returns 0. Otherwise it returns
\(mi1 and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
