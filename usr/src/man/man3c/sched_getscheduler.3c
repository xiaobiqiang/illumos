.TH SCHED_GETSCHEDULER 3C "Apr 1, 2008"
.SH NAME
sched_getscheduler \- get scheduling policy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sched.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsched_getscheduler\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function returns the scheduling policy of the
process specified by \fIpid\fR. If the value of \fIpid\fR is negative, the
behavior of the \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function is unspecified.
.sp
.LP
The values that can be returned by \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR are defined in
the header <\fBsched.h\fR> and described on the \fBsched_setscheduler\fR(3C)
manual page.
.sp
.LP
If a process specified by \fIpid\fR exists and if the calling process has
permission, the scheduling policy will be returned for the process whose
process ID is equal to \fIpid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpid\fR is 0, the scheduling policy will be returned for the calling
process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function returns the
scheduling policy of the specified process. If unsuccessful, the function
returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsched_getscheduler()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The requesting process does not have permission to determine the scheduling
policy of the specified process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
No process can be found corresponding to that specified by \fIpid\fR.
