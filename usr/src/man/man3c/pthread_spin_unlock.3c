.TH PTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCK 3C "Jan 30, 2004"
.SH NAME
pthread_spin_unlock \- unlock a spin lock object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc \fB-mt\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_spin_unlock\fR(\fBpthread_spinlock_t *\fR\fIlock\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_spin_unlock()\fR function releases the spin lock referenced by
\fIlock\fR which was locked with the \fBpthread_spin_lock\fR(3C) or
\fBpthread_spin_trylock\fR(3C) functions. The results are undefined if the lock
is not held by the calling thread. If there are threads spinning on the lock
when \fBpthread_spin_unlock()\fR is called, the lock becomes available and an
unspecified spinning thread acquires the lock.
.sp
.LP
The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized
thread spin lock.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBpthread_spin_unlock()\fR function returns 0.
Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
