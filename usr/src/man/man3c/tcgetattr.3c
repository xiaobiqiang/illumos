.SH NAME
tcgetattr \- get the parameters associated with the terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>

\fBint\fR \fBtcgetattr\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBstruct termios *\fR\fItermios_p\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetattr()\fR function gets the parameters associated with the terminal
referred to by \fIfildes\fR and stores them in the \fBtermios\fR structure (see
\fBtermio\fR(7I)) referenced by \fItermios_p\fR. The \fIfildes\fR argument is
an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fItermios_p\fR argument is a pointer to a \fBtermios\fR structure.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetattr()\fR operation is allowed from any process.
.sp
.LP
If the terminal device supports different input and output baud rates, the baud
rates stored in the \fBtermios\fR structure returned by \fBtcgetattr()\fR
reflect the actual baud rates, even if they are equal. If differing baud rates
are not supported, the rate returned as the output baud rate is the actual baud
rate. If the terminal device does not support split baud rates, the input baud
rate stored in the \fBtermios\fR structure will be 0.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetattr()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOTTY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The file associated with \fIfildes\fR is not a terminal.
