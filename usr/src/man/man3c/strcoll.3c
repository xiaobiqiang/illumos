.TH STRCOLL 3C "Jun 23, 2014"
.SH NAME
strcoll, strcoll_l \- string collation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>

\fBint\fR \fBstrcoll\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIs1\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIs2\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBstrcoll_l\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIs1\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIs2\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Both \fBstrcoll()\fR and \fBstrxfrm\fR(3C) provide for locale-specific string
sorting.  \fBstrcoll()\fR is intended for applications in which the number of
comparisons per string is small. When strings are to be compared a number of
times, \fBstrxfrm\fR(3C) is a more appropriate function because the
transformation process occurs only once.
.LP
The \fBstrcoll_l()\fR function behaves
identically to \fBstrcoll()\fR, except instead of operating in the current
locale, it operates in the locale specified by \fIloc\fR.
.LP
The \fBstrcoll()\fR function does not change the setting of \fBerrno\fR if
successful.
.LP
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application wishing
to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to 0, then call
\fBstrcoll()\fR, then check \fBerrno\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBstrcoll()\fR returns an integer greater than,
equal to, or less than zero in direct correlation to whether string \fIs1\fR is
greater than, equal to, or less than the string \fIs2\fR.  The comparison is
based on strings interpreted as appropriate to the locale
category \fBLC_COLLATE\fR (see \fBsetlocale\fR(3C)).
.LP
On error, \fBstrcoll()\fR may set \fBerrno\fR, but no return value is reserved
to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBstrcoll()\fR and \fBstrcoll_l()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIs1\fR or \fIs2\fR arguments contain characters outside the domain of the
collating sequence.
