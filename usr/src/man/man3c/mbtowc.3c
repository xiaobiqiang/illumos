.SH NAME
mbtowc, mbtowc_l \- convert a character to a wide-character code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmbtowc\fR(\fBwchar_t *restrict\fR \fIpwc\fR, \fBconst char *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmbtowc_l\fR(\fBwchar_t *restrict\fR \fIpwc\fR, \fBconst char *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR,
    \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
If \fIs\fR is not a null pointer, \fBmbtowc()\fR determines the number of the
bytes that constitute the character pointed to by \fIs\fR. It then determines
the wide-character code for the value of type \fBwchar_t\fR that corresponds to
that character. (The value of the wide-character code corresponding to the null
byte is 0.) If the character is valid and \fIpwc\fR is not a null pointer,
\fBmbtowc()\fR stores the wide-character code in the object pointed to by
\fIpwc\fR.
.LP
A call with \fIs\fR as a null pointer causes this function to return \fB0\fR.
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the
current locale. At most \fIn\fR bytes of the array pointed to by \fIs\fR will
be examined.
.LP
The function \fBmbtowc_l()\fR behaves identically to \fBmbtowc()\fR, except
instead of using the current locale, it uses the locale as specified by
\fIloc\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
If \fIs\fR is a null pointer, these functions return \fB0\fR. If \fIs\fR is not
a null pointer, they return \fB0\fR (if \fIs\fR points to the null
byte), the number of bytes that constitute the converted character (if the next
\fIn\fR or fewer bytes form a valid character), or  \fB\(mi1\fR and may set
\fBerrno\fR to indicate the error (if they do not form a valid character).
.LP
In no case will the value returned be greater than \fIn\fR or the value of the
\fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR macro.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fBmbtowc()\fR and \fBmbtowc_l()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEILSEQ\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
Invalid character sequence is detected.
