.TH PTHREAD_KEY_DELETE 3C "Mar 23, 2005"
.SH NAME
pthread_key_delete \- delete thread-specific data key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_key_delete\fR(\fBpthread_key_t\fR \fIkey\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_key_delete()\fR function deletes a thread-specific data key
previously returned by \fBpthread_key_create()\fR. The thread-specific data
values associated with \fIkey\fR need not be  \fINULL\fR at the time
\fBpthread_key_delete()\fR is called. It is the responsibility of the
application to free any application storage or perform any cleanup actions for
data structures related to the deleted key or associated thread-specific data
in any threads; this cleanup can be done either before or after
\fBpthread_key_delete()\fR is called. Any attempt to use \fIkey\fR following
the call to \fBpthread_key_delete()\fR results in undefined behaviour.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_key_delete()\fR function is callable from within destructor
functions. No destructor functions will be invoked by
\fBpthread_key_delete()\fR. Any destructor function that may have been
associated with \fIkey\fR will no longer be called upon thread exit.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_key_delete()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR.
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_key_delete()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIkey\fR value is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_key_delete()\fR function will not return an error code of
\fBEINTR\fR.
