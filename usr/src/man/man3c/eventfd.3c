.Dt EVENTFD 3C
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm eventfd
.Nd create a file descriptor for event notification
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/eventfd.h
.Ft int
.Fo eventfd
.Fa "unsigned int initval"
.Fa "int flags"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn eventfd
function creates an
.Xr eventfd 5
instance that has an associated 64-bit unsigned counter.
It returns a file descriptor that can be operated upon via
.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr write 2
and the facilities that notify of file descriptor activity (e.g.,
.Xr poll 2 ,
.Xr port_get 3C ,
.Xr epoll_wait 3C Ns ).
To dispose of the instance,
.Xr close 2
should be called on the file descriptor.
.Pp
The
.Fa initval
argument specifies the initial value of the 64-bit counter associated with the
instance.
(Note that this limits the initial value to be a 32-bit quantity despite the
fact that the underlying counter is 64-bit.)
.Pp
The \fIflags\fR argument specifies additional parameters for the
instance, and can have any of the following values:
.Bl -hang -width Ds
.It Sy EFD_CLOEXEC
.Bd -filled -compact
Instance will be closed upon an
.Xr exec 2 ;
see
.Xr open 2 Ns 's
description of
.Sy O_CLOEXEC .
.Ed
.It Sy EFD_NONBLOCK
.Bd -filled -compact
Instance will be set to be non-blocking.
A
.Xr read 2
on an
.Sy eventfd
instance that has been initialized with
.Sy EFD_NONBLOCK
will return
.Sy EAGAIN
in lieu of blocking if the count associated with the instance is zero.
.Ed
.It EFD_SEMAPHORE
.Bd -filled -compact
Provide counting semaphore semantics whereby a
.Xr read 2
will atomically decrement rather than atomically clear the count when it
becomes non-zero.
See below for details on
.Xr read 2
semantics.
.Ed
.El
.Pp
The following operations can be performed upon an
.Sy eventfd
instance:
.Bl -hang -width Ds
.It Sy read(2)
.Bd -filled -compact
Atomically reads and modifies the value of the 64-bit counter associated
with the instance.
The precise semantics of
.Xr read 2
depend on the disposition of
.Sy EFD_SEMAPHORE
with
respect to the instance: if
.Sy EFD_SEMAPHORE
was set when the instance was created,
.Xr read 2
will
.Em atomically decrement
the counter if (and when) it is non-zero, copying the value 1 to the eight
byte buffer passed to the system call; if
.Sy EFD_SEMAPHORE
was not set,
.Xr read 2
will
.Em atomically clear
the counter if (and when) it is non-zero, copying the former value of the
counter to the eight byte buffer passed to the
system call.
In either case,
.Xr read 2
will block if the counter is
zero (or return
.Sy EAGAIN
if the instance was created with
.Sy EFD_NONBLOCK Ns ).
If the buffer specified to
.Xr read 2
is less than
eight bytes in length,
.Sy EINVAL
will be returned.
.Ed
.It Sy write(2)
.Bd -filled -compact
Atomically adds the 64-bit value pointed to by the buffer to the 64-bit
counter associated with the instance.
If the resulting value would overflow, the
.Xr write 2
will block until the value would not overflow
(or return
.Sy EAGAIN
EAGAIN if the instance was created with
.Sy EFD_NONBLOCK Ns ).
If the buffer specified to
.Xr write 2
is less than eight bytes in length,
.Sy EINVAL
will be returned.
.Ed
.It Sy poll(2), port_get(3C), epoll_wait(3C)
.Bd -filled -compact
Provide notification when the 64-bit counter associated
with the instance is ready for reading or writing, as specified.
If the 64-bit value associated with the instance is non-zero,
.Sy POLLIN
and
.Sy POLLRDNORM
will be set; if the value 1 can be added the value
without blocking,
.Sy POLLOUT
and
.Sy POLLWRNORM
will be set.
.Ed
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a file descriptor associated with the instance
is returned.
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn eventfd
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er EINVAL
The
.Fa flags
are invalid.
.It Er EMFILE
There are currently
.Pf { Sy OPEN_MAX Ns }
file descriptors open in the calling process.
