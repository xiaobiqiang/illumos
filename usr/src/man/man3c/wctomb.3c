.SH NAME
wctomb, wctomb_l \- convert a wide-character code to a character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwctomb\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fIs\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwchar\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwctomb_l\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fIs\fR, \fBwchar_t\fR \fIwchar\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBwctomb()\fR function determines the number of bytes needed to represent
the character corresponding to the wide-character code whose value is
\fIwchar\fR. It stores the character representation (possibly multiple bytes)
in the array object pointed to by \fIs\fR (if \fIs\fR is not a null pointer).
At most \fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR bytes are stored.
.LP
A call with \fIs\fR as a null pointer causes this function to return \fB0\fR.
The behavior of this function is affected by the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR category of the
current locale.
.LP
The function \fBwctomb_l()\fR behaves identically to \fBwctomb()\fR, except
instead of operating in the current locale, it operates in the locale
specified by \fIloc\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
If \fIs\fR is a null pointer, \fBwctomb()\fR returns \fB0\fR value. If \fIs\fR
is not a null pointer, \fBwctomb()\fR returns \fB\(mi1\fR if the value of
\fIwchar\fR does not correspond to a valid character, or returns the number of
bytes that constitute the character corresponding to the value of \fIwchar\fR.
.LP
In no case will the value returned be greater than the value of the
\fBMB_CUR_MAX\fR macro.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
