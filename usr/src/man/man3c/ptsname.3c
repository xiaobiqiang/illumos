.TH PTSNAME 3C "Aug 14, 2002"
.SH NAME
ptsname \- get name of the slave pseudo-terminal device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

\fBchar *\fR\fBptsname\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBptsname()\fR function returns the name of the slave pseudo-terminal
device associated with a master pseudo-terminal device. \fIfildes\fR is a file
descriptor returned from a successful open of the master device.
\fBptsname()\fR returns a pointer to a string containing the null-terminated
path name of the slave device of the form \fB/dev/pts/N\fR, where \fBN\fR is a
non-negative integer.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the function \fBptsname()\fR returns a pointer to a
string which is the name of the pseudo-terminal slave device. This value points
to a static data area that is overwritten by each call to \fBptsname()\fR. Upon
failure, \fBptsname()\fR returns \fINULL\fR. This could occur if \fIfildes\fR
is an invalid file descriptor or if  the slave device name does not exist in
the file system.
