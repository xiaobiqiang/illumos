#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getschedparam\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The functions \fBpthread_attr_setschedparam()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getschedparam()\fR, respectively, set and get the scheduling
parameter attributes in the \fIattr\fR argument. The contents of the
\fIparam\fR structure are defined in \fB<sched.h>\fR\&. The only required
member of \fIparam\fR is \fIsched_priority\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_attr_setschedparam()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getschedparam()\fR functions return  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an
error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setschedparam()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
