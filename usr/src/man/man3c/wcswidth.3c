.TH WCSWIDTH 3C "Jul 11, 2014"
.SH NAME
wcswidth, wcswidth_l \- number of column positions of a wide-character string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwcswidth\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIpwcs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>
#include <xlocale.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwcswidth_l\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIpwcs\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwcswidth()\fR function determines the number of column positions
required for \fIn\fR wide-character codes (or fewer than \fIn\fR wide-character
codes if a null wide-character code is encountered before \fIn\fR
wide-character codes are exhausted) in the string pointed to by \fIpwcs\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
The \fBwcswidth()\fR function either returns \fB0\fR (if \fIpwcs\fR points to a
null wide-character code), or returns the number of column positions to be
occupied by the wide-character string pointed to by \fIpwcs\fR, or returns
\fB\(mi1\fR (if any of the first \fIn\fR wide-character codes in the
wide-character string pointed to by \fIpwcs\fR is not a printing wide-character
code).
.LP
The function \fBwcwidth_l()\fR behaves identically to \fBwcwidth()\fR, except
instead of operating in the current environemtn, it operates in the environment
specified by \fIloc\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.LP
