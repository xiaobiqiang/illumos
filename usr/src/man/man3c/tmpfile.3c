.TH TMPFILE 3C "Aug 4, 2003"
.SH NAME
tmpfile \- create a temporary file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

\fBFILE *\fR\fBtmpfile\fR(\fBvoid\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtmpfile()\fR function creates a temporary file and opens a corresponding
stream.  The file will automatically be deleted when all references to the file
are closed.  The file is opened as in \fBfopen\fR(3C) for update (\fBw+\fR).
.sp
.LP
The largest value that can be represented correctly in an object of type
\fBoff_t\fR will be established as the offset maximum in the open file
description.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBtmpfile()\fR returns a pointer to the stream of
the file that is created. Otherwise, it returns a null pointer and sets
\fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtmpfile()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINTR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
A signal was caught during the execution of \fBtmpfile()\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEMFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
There are \fBOPEN_MAX\fR file descriptors currently open in the calling
process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOSPC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The directory or file system which would contain the new file cannot be
expanded.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBtmpfile()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEMFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
There are \fBFOPEN_MAX\fR streams currently open in the calling process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
Insufficient storage space is available.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The stream refers to a file which is unlinked.  If the process is killed in the
period between file creation and unlinking, a permanent file may be left
behind.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtmpfile()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file
offsets. See \fBlf64\fR(5).
