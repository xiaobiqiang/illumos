.SH NAME
door_cred \- return credential information associated with the client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR \fB-mt\fR [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <door.h>

\fBint\fR \fBdoor_cred\fR(\fBdoor_cred_t *\fR\fIinfo\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBdoor_cred()\fR function returns credential information associated with
the client (if any) of the current door invocation.
.sp
.LP
The contents of the \fIinfo\fR argument include the following fields:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
uid_t   dc_euid;        /* Effective uid of client */
gid_t   dc_egid;        /* Effective gid of client */
uid_t   dc_ruid;        /* Real uid of client */
gid_t   dc_rgid;        /* Real gid of client */
pid_t   dc_pid;         /* pid of client */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The credential information associated with the client refers to the information
from the immediate caller; not necessarily from the first thread in a chain of
door calls.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBdoor_cred()\fR returns \fB0\fR. Otherwise,
\fBdoor_cred()\fR returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fBdoor_cred()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR

\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad

.RE

.SH USAGE

\fBdoor_ucred\fR(3C) function in place of \fBdoor_cred()\fR.
