.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn thrd_detach
function causes a thread to be considered detached from the rest of the
execution environment.
While detached threads are still fully observable, they cannot be joined with,
calls to
.Fn thrd_join
will fail.
In addition, if all non-detached threads have terminated, the program will
terminate; detached threads cannot keep a program running.
The act of calling
.Fn thrd_detach
on a thread does not cause it to terminate.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn thrd_detach
function returns
.Sy thrd_success .
Otherwise, it returns
.Sy thrd_error ,
indicating that an error has occurred.
