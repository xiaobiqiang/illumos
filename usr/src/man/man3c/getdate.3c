.TH GETDATE 3C "Nov 1, 2003"
.SH NAME
getdate \- convert user format date and time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <time.h>

\fBstruct tm *\fR\fBgetdate\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIstring\fR);
extern int getdate_err;
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgetdate()\fR function converts user-definable date and/or time
specifications pointed to by \fIstring\fR to a \fBtm\fR structure. The \fBtm\fR
structure is defined in the <\fBtime.h\fR> header.
.sp
.LP
User-supplied templates are used to parse and interpret the input string.  The
templates are  text files created by the user and identified via the
environment variable \fBDATEMSK\fR. Each line in the template represents an
acceptable date and/or time specification using  conversion specifications
similar to those used by \fBstrftime\fR(3C) and \fBstrptime\fR(3C). Dates
before 1902 and after 2037 are illegal. The first line in the template that
matches the input specification is used for interpretation and conversion into
the internal time format.

.SS "General Specifications"
.sp
.LP
A conversion specification that is an ordinary character is executed by
scanning the next character from the buffer. If the character scanned from the
buffer differs from the one comprising the conversion specification, the
specification fails, and the differing and subsequent characters remain
unscanned.
.sp
.LP
A series of conversion specifications composed of \fB%n\fR, \fB%t\fR, white
space characters, or any combination is executed by scanning up to the first
character that is not white space (which remains unscanned), or until no more
characters can be scanned.
.sp
.LP
Any other conversion specification is executed by scanning characters until a
character matching the next conversion specification is scanned, or until no
more characters can be scanned.  These characters, except the one matching the
next conversion specification, are then compared to the locale values
associated with the conversion specifier.  If a match is found, values for the
appropriate \fItm\fR structure members are set to values corresponding to the
locale information. If no match is found, \fBgetdate()\fR fails and no more
characters are scanned.
.sp
.LP
The month names, weekday names, era names, and alternative numeric symbols can
consist of any combination of upper and lower case letters.  The user can
request that the input date or time specification be in a specific language by
setting the \fBLC_TIME\fR category using \fBsetlocale\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, \fBgetdate()\fR returns a pointer to a \fBtm\fR structure;
otherwise, it returns \fINULL\fR and sets the global variable \fBgetdate_err\fR
to indicate the error. Subsequent calls to \fBgetdate()\fR alter the contents
of \fBgetdate_err\fR.

The following example shows the possible contents of a template:

run job at %I %p,%B %dnd

.sp
.LP
The following are examples of valid input specifications for the above
template:

.sp

.nf
getdate("10/1/87 4 PM")
getdate("Friday")
getdate("Friday September 19 1987, 10:30:30")

getdate("at monday the 1st of december in 1986")
getdate("run job at 3 PM, december 2nd")
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If the \fBLANG\fR environment variable is set to  \fBde\fR (German), the
following is valid:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
getdate("freitag den 10. oktober 1986 10.30 Uhr")

Local time and date specification are also supported. The following examples
show how local date and time specification can be defined in the template.
