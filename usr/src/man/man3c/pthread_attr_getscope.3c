.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getscope\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIcontentionscope\fR);

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_setscope\fR(\fBpthread_attr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR, \fBint\fR \fIcontentionscope\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setscope()\fR and \fBpthread_attr_getscope()\fR functions
are used to set and get the \fIcontentionscope\fR attribute in the \fIattr\fR
object.
.sp
.LP
The \fIcontentionscope\fR attribute can have the value
\fBPTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM\fR, signifying system scheduling contention scope, or
\fBPTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS\fR, signifying process scheduling contention scope.
.sp
.LP
The symbols \fBPTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM\fR and \fBPTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS\fR are
defined by the header <\fBpthread.h\fR>.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_attr_setscope()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getscope()\fR functions return \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an error
number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setscope()\fR, or \fBpthread_attr_getscope()\fR, function
may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fIattr\fR or \fIcontentionscope\fR is invalid.

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the
specified attributes using \fBpthread_create()\fR. Using these routines does
not affect the current running thread.
