.TH SCHED_GETPARAM 3C "Apr 1, 2008"
.SH NAME
sched_getparam \- get scheduling parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sched.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsched_getparam\fR(\fBpid_t\fR \fIpid\fR, \fBstruct sched_param *\fR\fIparam\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsched_getparam()\fR function returns the scheduling parameters of a
process specified by \fIpid\fR in the \fBsched_param\fR structure pointed to by
\fIparam\fR. The only required member of \fIparam\fR is \fIsched_priority\fR.
.sp
.LP
If a process specified by \fIpid\fR exists and if the calling process has
permission, the scheduling parameters for the process whose process ID is equal
to \fIpid\fR will be returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpid\fR is 0, the scheduling parameters for the calling process will be
returned. The behavior of the \fBsched_getparam()\fR function is unspecified if
the value of \fIpid\fR is negative.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBsched_getparam()\fR function returns
\fB0\fR. If the call to \fBsched_getparam()\fR is unsuccessful, the function
returns \fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBsched_getparam()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The requesting process does not have permission to obtain the scheduling
parameters of the specified process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
No process can be found corresponding to that specified by \fIpid\fR.
