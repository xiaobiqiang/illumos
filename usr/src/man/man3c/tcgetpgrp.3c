.SH NAME
tcgetpgrp \- get foreground process group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

\fBpid_t\fR \fBtcgetpgrp\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetpgrp()\fR function will return the value of the process group
\fBID\fR of the foreground process group associated with the terminal.
.sp
.LP
If there is no foreground process group, \fBtcgetpgrp()\fR returns a value
greater than 1 that does not match the process group \fBID\fR of any existing
process group.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetpgrp()\fR function is allowed from a process that is a member of a
background process group; however, the information may be subsequently changed
by a process that is a member of a foreground process group.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBtcgetpgrp()\fR returns the value of the process
group \fBID\fR of the foreground process associated with the terminal.
Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBtcgetpgrp()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIfildes\fR argument is not a valid file descriptor.
