.SH NAME
wmemcmp \- compare wide-characters in memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwmemcmp\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIn\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemcmp()\fR function compares the first \fIn\fR wide-characters of the
object pointed to by \fIws1\fR to the first \fIn\fR wide-characters of the
object pointed to by \fIws2\fR. This function is not affected by locale and all
\fBwchar_t\fR values are treated identically.  The null  wide-character and
\fBwchar_t\fR values not corresponding to valid  characters are not treated
specially.
.sp
.LP
If \fIn\fR is zero,  \fIws1\fR and \fIws2\fR must be a valid pointers and the
function behaves as if the two objects compare equal.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBwmemcmp()\fR function returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less
than 0, accordingly as the object pointed to by \fIws1\fR is greater than,
equal to, or less than the object pointed to by \fIws2\fR.
.SH ERRORS

.LP
No errors are defined.
