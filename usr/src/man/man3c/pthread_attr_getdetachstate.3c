.TH PTHREAD_ATTR_GETDETACHSTATE 3C "Mar 23, 2005"
.SH NAME
pthread_attr_getdetachstate, pthread_attr_setdetachstate \- get or set
detachstate attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_setdetachstate\fR(\fBpthread_attr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR,
     \fBint\fR \fIdetachstate\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getdetachstate\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR,
     \fBint *\fR\fIdetachstate\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fIdetachstate\fR attribute controls whether the thread is created in a
detached state. If the thread is created detached, then use of the  \fBID\fR of
the newly created thread by the \fBpthread_detach()\fR or \fBpthread_join()\fR
function is an error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setdetachstate()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getdetachstate()\fR, respectively, set and get the
\fIdetachstate\fR attribute in the \fIattr\fR object.
.sp
.LP
The \fIdetachstate\fR can be set to either  \fBPTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED\fR or
\fBPTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.\fR A value of  \fBPTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED\fR causes
all threads created with \fIattr\fR to be in the detached state, whereas using
a value of \fBPTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE\fR causes all threads created with
\fIattr\fR to be in the joinable state. The default value of the
\fIdetachstate\fR attribute is \fBPTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.\fR
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpthread_attr_setdetachstate()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getdetachstate()\fR return a value of  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an
error number is returned to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_getdetachstate()\fR function stores the value of the
\fIdetachstate\fR attribute in \fIdetachstate\fR if successful.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setdetachstate()\fR or \fBpthread_attr_getdetachstate()\fR
functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fIattr\fR or \fIdetachstate\fR is invalid.
