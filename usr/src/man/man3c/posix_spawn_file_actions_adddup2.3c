.TH POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTIONS_ADDDUP2 3C "Jan 30, 2004"
.SH NAME
posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 \- add dup2 action to spawn file actions
object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fR(
     \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fR\fIfile_actions\fR, \fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR,
     \fBint\fR \fInewfildes\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR function adds a \fBdup2\fR(3C)
action to the object referenced by \fIfile_actions\fR that causes the file
descriptor \fIfildes\fR to be duplicated as \fInewfildes\fR (as if
\fBdup2\fR(\fIfildes\fR, \fInewfildes\fR) had been called) when a new process
is spawned using this file actions object.
.sp
.LP
A spawn file actions object is as defined in
\fBposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR
function returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is be returned to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The value specified by \fIfildes\fR or \fInewfildes\fR is negative or greater
than or equal to {\fBOPEN_MAX\fR}.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOMEM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn file actions object.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The value specified by \fIfile_actions\fR is invalid.
.RE

.sp
.LP
It is not considered an error for the \fIfildes\fR argument passed to
\fBposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2()\fR to specify a file descriptor for which
the specified operation could not be performed at the time of the call. Any
such error will be detected when the associated file actions object is later
used during a \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) or \fBposix_spawnp\fR(3C) operation.
