.TH PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSTACKSIZE 3C "Mar 23, 2005"
.SH NAME
pthread_attr_getstacksize, pthread_attr_setstacksize \- get or set stacksize
attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_getstacksize\fR(\fBconst pthread_attr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR,
     \fBsize_t *restrict\fR \fIstacksize\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBpthread_attr_setstacksize\fR(\fBpthread_attr_t *\fR\fIattr\fR, \fBsize_t\fR \fIstacksize\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The functions \fBpthread_attr_setstacksize()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getstacksize()\fR, respectively, set and get the thread
creation \fIstacksize\fR attribute in the \fIattr\fR object.
.sp
.LP
The \fIstacksize\fR attribute defines the minimum stack size (in bytes)
allocated for the created threads stack. When the \fIstacksize\fR argument is
\fINULL\fR, the default stack size becomes \fB1\fR megabyte for 32-bit
processes and  \fB2\fR megabytes for 64-bit processes.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBpthread_attr_setstacksize()\fR and
\fBpthread_attr_getstacksize()\fR return a value of  \fB0\fR. Otherwise, an
error number is returned to indicate the error. The
\fBpthread_attr_getstacksize()\fR function stores the \fIstacksize\fR attribute
value in \fIstacksize\fR if successful.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_attr_setstacksize()\fR or \fBpthread_attr_getstacksize()\fR
function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fIattr\fR or \fIstacksize\fR is invalid.
