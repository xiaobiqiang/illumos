.TH SEEKDIR 3C "Aug 14, 2002"
.SH NAME
seekdir \- set position of directory stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBseekdir\fR(\fBDIR *\fR\fIdirp\fR, \fBlong int\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBseekdir()\fR function sets the position of the next \fBreaddir\fR(3C)
operation on the directory stream specified by \fIdirp\fR to the position
specified by \fIloc\fR. The value of \fIloc\fR should have been returned from
an earlier call to \fBtelldir\fR(3C). The new position reverts to the one
associated with the directory stream when \fBtelldir()\fR was performed.
.sp
.LP
If the value of \fIloc\fR was not obtained from an earlier call to
\fBtelldir()\fR or if a call to \fBrewinddir\fR(3C) occurred between the call
to \fBtelldir()\fR and the call to \fBseekdir()\fR, the results of
subsequent calls to \fBreaddir()\fR are unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBseekdir()\fR function returns no value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
