.SH NAME
posix_spawn_pipe_np \- spawn a process with connected pipe
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>

\fBint\fR \fBposix_spawn_pipe_np\fR(\fBpid_t *restrict\fR \fIpid\fR,
     \fBint *restrict\fR \fIfdp\fR,
     \fBconst char *restrict\fR \fIcmd\fR,
     \fBboolean_t\fR \fIwrite\fR,
     \fBconst posix_spawn_file_actions_t *\fR\fIfile_actions\fR,
     \fBconst posix_spawnattr_t *restrict\fR \fIattr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBposix_spawn_pipe_np()\fR function creates a new process
(child process) to run \fBsh -c \fIcmd\fR\fR, and connects the new
process's standard input or output to a file descriptor.
.sp
.LP
The new process's environment (the \fIenviron\fR global variable) is
inherited from the current process.
.sp
.LP
The \fIcmd\fR argument is the string for the child shell process to execute.
.sp
.LP
If the \fIwrite\fR argument is set, the returned file descriptor will be
connected to the new process's standard input, and will be opened for
writing.  Otherwise, the file descriptor will be connected to the new
process's standard output, and will be opened for reading.
.sp
.LP
If \fIfile_actions\fR is not \fINULL\fR, then the file descriptors open
in the child process are those open in the calling process as modified
by the spawn file actions object pointed to by \fIfile_actions\fR and
the \fBFD_CLOEXEC\fR flag of each remaining open file descriptor after
the spawn file actions have been processed.  See \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C)
for details on the behavior of \fIfile_actions\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIattr\fR is not \fINULL\fR, then the signal mask, signal default or
ignore actions, and the effective user and group IDs for the child
process are changed as specified in the attributes object referenced by
\fIattr\fR.  See \fBposix_spawn\fR(3C) for details on the behavior of
\fIattr\fR.
.sp
.LP
All process attributes, other than those influenced by the attributes set in
the object referenced by \fIattr\fR as specified above or by the file
descriptor manipulations specified in \fIfile_actions\fR appear in the new
process image as though \fBfork()\fR had been called to create a child process
and then a member of the \fBexec\fR family of functions had been called by the
child process to execute \fB/bin/sh\fR.
.sp
.LP
The fork handlers are not run when \fBposix_spawn_pipe_np()\fR is called.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBposix_spawn_pipe_np()\fR returns the
process ID of the child process to the parent process in the variable
pointed to by a non-null \fIpidp\fR argument, returns the file
descriptor which is connected to the child process in the variable
pointed to by a non-null \fIfdp\fR argument, and returns zero as the
function return value. Otherwise, no child process is created, the value
stored into the variable pointed to by a non-null \fIpidp\fR and
\fIfdp\fR is unspecified, and an error number is returned as the
function return value to indicate the error.
