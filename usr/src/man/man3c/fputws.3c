.TH FPUTWS 3C "Nov 1, 2003"
.SH NAME
fputws \- put wide character string on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfputws\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *restrict\fR \fIs\fR, \fBFILE *restrict\fR \fIstream\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfputws()\fR function writes a character string corresponding to the
(null-terminated) wide character string pointed to by \fIws\fR to the stream
pointed to by \fIstream\fR. No character corresponding to the terminating null
wide-character code is written, nor is a \fBNEWLINE\fR character appended.
.sp
.LP
The \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the file will be marked for
update between the successful execution of \fBfputws()\fR and the next
successful completion of a call to \fBfflush\fR(3C) or \fBfclose\fR(3C) on the
same stream or a call to \fBexit\fR(2) or \fBabort\fR(3C).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBfputws()\fR returns a non-negative value.
Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR, sets an error indicator for the stream, and
sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
Refer to \fBfputwc\fR(3C).
