.TH MQ_UNLINK 3C "Feb 5, 2008"
.SH NAME
mq_unlink \- remove a message queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <mqueue.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmq_unlink\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIname\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmq_unlink()\fR function removes the message queue named by the pathname
\fIname\fR. After a successful call to \fBmq_unlink()\fR with \fIname\fR, a
call to \fBmq_open\fR(3C) with \fIname\fR fails if the flag \fBO_CREAT\fR is
not set in \fIflags\fR. If one or more processes have the message queue open
when \fBmq_unlink()\fR is called, destruction of the message queue is postponed
until all references to the message queue have been closed. Calls to
\fBmq_open\fR(3C) to re-create the message queue may fail until the message
queue is actually removed. However, the \fBmq_unlink()\fR call need not block
until all references have been closed; it may return immediately.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBmq_unlink()\fR returns \fB0\fR; otherwise, the
named message queue is not changed by this function call, the function returns
\fB\(mi1\fR and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBmq_unlink()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEACCES\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
Permission is denied to unlink the named message queue.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
The length of the \fIname\fR string exceeds  \fBPATH_MAX\fR, or a pathname
component is longer than  \fINAME_MAX\fR while  \fB_POSIX_NO_TRUNC\fR is in
effect.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOENT\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 17n
The named message queue, \fIname\fR, does not exist.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR \fR
.ad

.SH NOTES

.LP
Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output
option. Prior to this release, this function always returned \fB\(mi1\fR and
set \fBerrno\fR to \fBENOSYS\fR.
