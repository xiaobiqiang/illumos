.TH ENCRYPT 3C "May 2, 2001"
.SH NAME
encrypt \- encoding function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <crypt.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBencrypt\fR(\fBchar\fR \fIblock[64]\fR, \fBint\fR \fIedflag\fR);
.fi

.SS "Standard conforming"
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBencrypt\fR(\fBchar\fR \fIblock[64]\fR, \fBint\fR \fIedflag\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBencrypt()\fR function provides (rather primitive) access to the hashing
algorithm employed by the \fBcrypt\fR(3C) function. The key generated by
\fBsetkey\fR(3C) is used to encrypt the string \fIblock\fR with
\fBencrypt()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fIblock\fR argument to \fBencrypt()\fR is an array of length 64 bytes
containing only the bytes with numerical value of 0 and 1. The array is
modified in place to a similar array using the key set by \fBsetkey\fR(3C). If
\fIedflag\fR is 0, the argument is encoded.  If \fIedflag\fR is 1, the argument
may be decoded (see the \fBUSAGE\fR section below); if the argument is not
decoded, \fBerrno\fR will be set to \fBENOSYS\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBencrypt()\fR function returns no value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBencrypt()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOSYS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The functionality is not supported on this implementation.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
In some environments, decoding may not be implemented.  This is related to U.S.
Government restrictions on encryption and decryption routines: the \fBDES\fR
decryption algorithm cannot be exported outside the U.S.A. Historical practice
has been to ship a different version of the encryption library without the
decryption feature in the routines supplied. Thus the exported version of
\fBencrypt()\fR does encoding but not decoding.
.sp
.LP
Because \fBencrypt()\fR does not return a value, applications wishing to check
for errors should set \fBerrno\fR to 0, call \fBencrypt()\fR, then test
\fBerrno\fR and, if it is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
