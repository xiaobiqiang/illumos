.Sh NAME
.Nm getentropy
.Nd get entropy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getentropy "void *buf" "size_t buflen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
fills a buffer with high-quality entropy, which can be used
as input for process-context pseudorandom generators like
.Xr arc4random 3C .
.Pp
The maximum buffer size permitted is 256 bytes.
If
.Va buflen
exceeds this, an error of
.Er EIO
will be indicated.
.Pp
.Nm
is not intended for regular code; please use the
.Xr arc4random 3C
family of functions instead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getentropy
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er EFAULT
The
.Fa buf
parameter points to an
invalid address.
.It Er EIO
Too many bytes requested, or some other fatal error occurred.
