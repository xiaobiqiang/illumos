.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBffs()\fR, \fBffsl()\fR, and \fBffsll()\fR functions finds the first bit set
(beginning with the least significant bit) and return the index of that bit.
Bits are numbered starting at one (the least significant bit).
.sp
.LP
The \fBfls()\fR, \fBflsl()\fR, and \fBflsll()\fR functions find the last bit set
(beginning with the least significant bit) and return the index of that bit.
Bits are numbered starting at one (the least significant bit).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
The \fBffs()\fR, \fBffsl()\fR, and \fBffsll()\fR functions returns the index of
the first bit set.  If \fIi\fR is 0, then they return 0.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfls()\fR, \fBflsl()\fR, and \fBflsll()\fR functions return the index of
the last bit set.  If \fIi\fR is 0, then they return 0.
.SH ERRORS
