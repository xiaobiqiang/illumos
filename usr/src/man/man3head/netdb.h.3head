.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetdb.h\fR> header defines the type \fBin_port_t\fR and the type
\fBin_addr_t\fR as described in \fBin.h\fR(3HEAD).
.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetdb.h\fR> header defines the \fBhostent\fR structure that includes
the following members:

.LP
The <\fBnetdb.h\fR> header defines the \fBprotoent\fR structure that includes
the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf

The <\fBnetdb.h\fR> header defines the \fBservent\fR structure that includes
the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
char *s_name         /* oficial name of the service */

.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetdb.h\fR> header defines the macro \fBIPPORT_RESERVED\fR with the
value of the highest reserved Internet port number.
.sp

The <\fBnetdb.h\fR> header provides a declaration for \fBh_errno\fR:
.sp
.LP
extern int h_errno;
.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetdb.h\fR> header defines the following macros for use as error values
for \fBgethostbyaddr()\fR and \fBgethostbyname()\fR:
.sp
