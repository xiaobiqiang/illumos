.SH NAME
wait.h, wait \- wait status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB#include <sys/wait.h>\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
When a process waits for status from its children using either the
\fBwait\fR(3C) or \fBwaitpid\fR(3C) function, the status returned can be
evaluated with the following macros, defined in <\fBsys/wait.h\fR>. These
macros evaluate to integral expressions. The \fIstat\fR argument to these
macros is the integer value returned from \fBwait()\fR or \fBwaitpid()\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWCOREDUMP\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
If the value of \fBWIFSIGNALED\fR (\fIstat\fR) is non-zero, this macro
evaluates to a non-zero value if a core image of the terminated child was
created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWEXITSTATUS\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
If the value of  \fBWIFEXITED(\fR\fIstat\fR\fB)\fR is non-zero, this macro
evaluates to the exit code that the child process passed to  \fB_exit()\fR (see
\fBexit\fR(2)) or \fBexit\fR(3C), or the value that the child process returned
from \fBmain\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWIFCONTINUED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that
has continued.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWIFEXITED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that
terminated normally.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWIFSIGNALED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that
terminated due to the receipt of a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWIFSTOPPED\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a child process that
is currently stopped.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWSTOPSIG\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
If the value of \fBWIFSTOPPED(\fR\fIstat\fR\fB)\fR is non-zero, this macro
evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the child process to stop.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWTERMSIG\fR(\fIstat\fR)\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
If the value of  \fBWIFSIGNALED\fR(\fIstat\fR) is non-zero, this macro
evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the termination of the child
process.
.RE

.LP
The <\fBsys/wait.h\fR> header defines the symbolic constants listed below for
use with \fBwaitpid\fR(3C).
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWNOHANG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Do not hang if no status is available; return immediately.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWUNTRACED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Report status of stopped child process.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The symbolic constants listed below are defined as possible values for the
\fIoptions\fR argument to \fBwaitid\fR(2).
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWEXITED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Wait for processes that have exited.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWSTOPPED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Status is returned for any child that has stopped upon receipt of a signal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWCONTINUED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Status is returned for any child that was stopped and has been continued.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWNOHANG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Return immediately if there are no children to wait for.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWNOWAIT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Keep the process whose status is returned in \fBinfop\fR in a waitable state.

The type \fBidtype_t\fR is defined as an enumeration type whose possible values
include the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
P_ALL
P_PID
P_PGID

The \fBid_t\fR and \fBpid_t\fR types are defined as described in
<\fBsys/types.h\fR>.
.sp

The \fBsiginfo_t\fR type is defined as described in <\fBsignal.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrusage\fR structure is defined as described in <\fBsys/resource.h\fR>.

Inclusion of the <\fBsys/wait.h\fR> header can also make visible all symbols
from <\fBsignal.h\fR> and <\fBsys/resource.h\fR>.
