.SH NAME
utmpx.h, utmpx \- user accounting database definitions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <utmpx.h>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB<utmpx.h>\fR header defines the \fButmpx\fR structure, which includes
the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
char                  ut_user[];  /* user login name */
char                  ut_id[];    /* unspecified initialization */
                                  /* process identifier */
char                  ut_line[];  /* device name */
pid_t                 ut_pid;     /* process ID */
short                 ut_type;    /* type of entry */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
for X/Open compilation environments:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct ut_exit_status ut_exit; /* process termination/exit status*/
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
for all other compilation environments:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct exit_status    ut_exit;    /* process termination/exit status*/
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct timeval        ut_tv;      /* time entry was made */
int                   ut_session; /* session ID, used for windowing */
short                 ut_syslen;  /* significant length of ut_host */
                                  /* including terminating null */
char                  ut_host[];  /* remote host name */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBpid_t\fR type is defined through \fBtypedef\fR as described in
\fB<sys/types.h>\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtimeval\fR structure is defined as described in \fB<sys/time.h>\fR.
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the \fB<utmpx.h>\fR header can also make visible all symbols from
\fB<sys/time.h>\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following symbolic constants are defined as possible values for the
\fBut_type\fR member of the \fButmpx\fR structure:
