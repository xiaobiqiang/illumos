.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The <\fBlocale.h\fR> header provides a definition for the \fBlconv\fR
structure, which includes the following members. (See the definition of
\fBLC_MONETARY\fR in \fBlocale\fR(5).)

char         *grouping
char         *int_curr_symbol
char         int_frac_digits
char         int_n_cs_precedes
char         int_n_sep_by_space
char         int_n_sign_posn
char         int_p_cs_precedes
char         int_p_sep_by_space
char         int_p_sign_posn
char         *mon_decimal_point
char         *mon_grouping
char         *mon_thousands_sep
char         *negative_sign
char         n_cs_precedes

.LP
The <\fBlocale.h\fR> header defines \fINULL\fR (as defined in <\fBstddef.h\fR>)
and the following as macros:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LC_ALL
LC_COLLATE
LC_CTYPE
LC_MESSAGES
LC_MONETARY
LC_NUMERIC
LC_TIME
.fi
.in -2
.LP
The preceding expand to distinct integer constant expressions, for use as the
first argument to the \fBsetlocale()\fR function. See \fBsetlocale\fR(3C).
.LP
The <\fBlocale.h\fR> header also defines the following macros, for use with
\fBnewlocale\fR(3C):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
LC_ALL_MASK
LC_COLLATE_MASK
LC_CTYPE_MASK
LC_MESSAGES_MASK
LC_MONETARY_MASK
LC_NUMERIC_MASK
LC_TIME_MASK
.fi
.in -2
.LP
In addition, to facilitate the use of per-thread locales with the
.BR uselocale (3C)
function, the
.RB < locale.h >
header defines the following type and macro:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
locale_t
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.RS 6n
An opaque type that refers to a locale constructed through the use of
the
.BR newlocale (3C)
function.
.RE

.sp
.in +2
.nf
LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.RS 6n
A macro which expands to a
.B locale_t
that represents the current global locale as set by
.BR setlocale (3C).
.RE

.LP
Additional macro definitions, beginning with the characters \fBLC_\fR and an
uppercase letter, can also be specified here.
