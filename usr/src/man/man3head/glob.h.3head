.SH NAME
glob.h, glob \- pathname pattern-matching types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBglob.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBglob.h\fR> header defines the structures and symbolic constants used by
the \fBglob\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The structure type \fBglob_t\fR contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
size_t gl_pathc       /* count of paths matched by pattern */
char   **gl_pathv     /* pointer to a list of matched
                         pathnames */
size_t gl_offs        /* lots to reserve at the beginning
                         of gl_pathv */
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The following constants are provided as values for the \fBflags\fR argument:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_APPEND\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
Append generated pathnames to those previously obtained.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_DOOFFS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
Specify how many null pointers to add to the beginning of \fBgl_pathv\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_ERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
Cause \fBglob()\fR to return on error.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_MARK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
Each pathname that is a directory that matches pattern has a slash appended.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_NOCHECK\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
If pattern does not match any  pathname, then return a list consisting of only
pattern.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_NOESCAPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
Disable backslash escaping.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_NOSORT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n
Do not sort the pathnames returned.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following constants are defined as error return values:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_ABORTED\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
The scan was stopped because \fBGLOB_ERR\fR was set or \fB(*errfunc)()\fR
returned non-zero.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_NOMATCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
The pattern does not match any existing pathname, and \fBGLOB_NOCHECK\fR was
not set in flags.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGLOB_NOSPACE\fR\fR
