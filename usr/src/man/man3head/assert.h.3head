.TH ASSERT.H 3HEAD "Jan 14, 2015"
.SH NAME
assert.h, assert \- verify program assertion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBassert.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The <\fBassert.h\fR> header defines the \fBassert()\fR macro. It refers to the
macro \fBNDEBUG\fR which is not defined in the header. If \fBNDEBUG\fR is
defined as a macro name before the inclusion of this header, the \fBassert()\fR
macro is defined simply as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#define assert(ignore)((void) 0)
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in \fBassert\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The \fBassert()\fR macro is redefined according to the current state of
\fBNDEBUG\fR each time <\fBassert.h\fR> is included.
.sp
.LP
The \fBassert()\fR macro is implemented as a macro, not as a function. If the
macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function, the
behavior is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The <\fBassert.h\fR> header also defines the \fBstatic_assert()\fR macro. This
macros is similar to \fBassert()\fR; however, while \fBassert()\fR is used at
program execution time, \fBstatic_assert()\fR is evaluated and checked by the
compiler at compilation-time.
