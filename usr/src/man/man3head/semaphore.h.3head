.SH NAME
semaphore.h, semaphore \- semaphores
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBsemaphore.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBsemaphore.h\fR> header defines the \fBsem_t\fR type, used in performing
semaphore operations. The semaphore can be implemented using a file descriptor,
in which case applications are able to open up at least a total of
{\fBOPEN_MAX\fR} files and semaphores. The symbol \fBSEM_FAILED\fR is defined
(see \fBsem_open\fR(3C)).
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the <\fBsemaphore.h\fR> header can make visible symbols defined in
the headers <\fBfcntl.h\fR> and <\fBsys/types.h\fR>. See \fBfcntl.h\fR(3HEAD)
and \fBtypes.h\fR(3HEAD).
