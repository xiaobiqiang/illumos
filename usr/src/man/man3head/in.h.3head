.SH NAME
in.h, in \- Internet Protocol family
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <netinet/in.h>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the following types through
\fBtypedef\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBin_port_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
An unsigned integral type of exactly 16 bits.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBin_addr_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
An unsigned integral type of exactly 32 bits. The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header
defines the \fBin_addr\fR structure that includes the following member:
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the \fBin_addr\fR structure that
includes the following member:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
in_addr_t       s_addr
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the type \fBsa_family_t\fR as described
in \fBsocket.h\fR(3HEAD).
.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the following macros for use as values
of the \fIlevel\fR argument of \fBgetsockopt()\fR and \fBsetsockopt()\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBIPPROTO_IP\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 21n
Dummy for  \fBIP\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBIPPROTO_ICMP\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 21n
Control message protocol
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBIPPROTO_TCP\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 21n
\fBTCP\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBIPPROTO_UDP\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 21n
User datagram protocol The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the following
macros for use as destination addresses for \fBconnect()\fR, \fBsendmsg()\fR,
and \fBsendto()\fR:
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBINADDR_ANY\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 21n
Local host address
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBINADDR_BROADCAST\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 21n
Broadcast address
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines the \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure that is
used to store addresses for the Internet protocol family.  Values of this type
must be cast to \fBstruct sockaddr\fR for use with the socket interfaces.
.SS "Default"
.LP
For applications that do not require standard-conforming behavior (those that
use the socket interfaces described in section (3SOCKET) of the reference
manual; see \fBIntro\fR(3) and \fBstandards\fR(5)), the <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR>
header defines the \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure that includes the following
members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sa_family_t     sin_family
in_port_t       sin_port
struct in_addr  sin_addr
char            sin_zero[8]
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Standard conforming"
.LP
For applications that require standard-conforming behavior (those that use the
socket interfaces described in section (3XNET) of the reference manual; see
\fBIntro\fR(3) and \fBstandards\fR(5)), the <\fBnetinet/in.h\fR> header defines
the \fBsockaddr_in\fR structure that includes the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sa_family_t     sin_family
in_port_t       sin_port
struct in_addr  sin_addr
unsigned char   sin_zero[8]
.fi
.in -2
