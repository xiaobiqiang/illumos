.SH NAME
ftw.h, ftw \- file tree traversal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBftw.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBftw.h\fR> header defines the FTW structure that includes the following
members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int base
int level
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The <\fBftw.h\fR> header defines macros for use as values of  the third
argument to the application-supplied function that is  passed as the second
argument to \fBftw()\fR and \fBnftw()\fR (see \fBftw\fR(3C)):
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFTW_F\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n

\fB\fBFTW_DP\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
directory with subdirectories visited
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFTW_NS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n

.ad
.RS 11n
symbolic link that names a nonexistent file
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBftw.h\fR> header defines macros for use as values of the fourth
argument to \fBnftw()\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFTW_PHYS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Physical walk, does not follow symbolic links. Otherwise, \fBnftw()\fR follows
links but does not walk down any path that crosses itself.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFTW_MOUNT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The walk does not cross a mount point.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFTW_DEPTH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
All subdirectories are visited before the directory itself.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFTW_CHDIR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The walk changes to each direct ory before reading it.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The <\fBftw.h\fR> header defines the \fBstat\fR structure and the symbolic
names for \fBst_mode\fR and the file type test macros as described in
<\fBsys/stat.h\fR>.
.sp
.LP
Inclusion of the <\fBftw.h\fR> header might also make visible all symbols from
<\fBsys/stat.h\fR>.
