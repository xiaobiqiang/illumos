regex.h, regex \- regular expression matching types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBregex.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The <\fBregex.h\fR> header defines the structures and symbolic constants used
by the \fBregcomp()\fR, \fBregexec()\fR, \fBregerror()\fR, and \fBregfree()\fR
functions. See \fBregcomp\fR(3C).
.sp
.LP
The structure type \fBregex_t\fR contains the following member:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
size_t re_nsub     number of parenthesized subexpressions
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The type \fBsize_t\fR is defined as described in <\fBsys/types.h\fR>. See
\fBtypes.h\fR(3HEAD).
.sp
.LP
The type \fBregoff_t\fR is defined as a signed integer type that can hold the
largest value that can be stored in either a type \fBoff_t\fR or type
\fBssize_t\fR. The structure type \fBregmatch_t\fR contains the following
members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
regoff_t rm_so     byte offset from start of string to start
                   of substring
regoff_t rm_eo     byte offset from start of string of the
                   first character after the end of substring
.fi
.in -2
