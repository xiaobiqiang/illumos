.SH NAME
vipw \- edit the password file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/vipw\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBvipw\fR edits the password file while setting the appropriate locks, and
does any necessary processing after the password file is unlocked. If the
password file is already being edited, then you will be told to try again
later.  The \fBvi\fR(1) editor will be used unless the environment variable
\fBVISUAL\fR or \fBEDITOR\fR indicates an alternate editor.
.sp
.LP
\fBvipw\fR performs a number of consistency checks on the password entry for
root, and will not allow a password file with a "mangled" root entry to be
installed.  It also checks the \fB/etc/shells\fR file to verify the login shell
for root.
