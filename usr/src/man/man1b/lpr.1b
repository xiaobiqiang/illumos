.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlpr\fR utility submits print requests to a destination. \fBlpr\fR prints
files (\fIfile\fR) and associated information, collectively called a \fIprint
request\fR. If \fIfile\fR is not specified, \fBlpr\fR assumes the standard
input.
.sp
.LP
The print client commands locate destination information using the "printers"
database in the name service switch. See \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4),
\fBprinters\fR(4), and \fBprinters.conf\fR(4) for details.
.sp
.LP
Print requests with more than 52 \fIfile\fRs specified is truncated to 52 files
when the BSD print protocol is used for job submission.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR \fIclass\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints \fIclass\fR as the job classification on the banner page of the output.
Enclose \fIclass\fR in double quotes if it contains blanks. If \fIclass\fR is
not specified, the name of the system (as returned by \fBhostname\fR) is
printed as the job classification. See \fBhostname\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Suppresses printing of the banner page of the output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIindent\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Indents the output a specific number of \fISPACE\fR characters. Use
\fIindent\fR to indicate the number of \fISPACE\fR characters to be indented.
Specify \fIindent\fR as a positive integer. If the optional argument to indent
is not specified, then eight \fISPACE\fR characters is the default. The
\fB-i\fR option is ignored unless it is specified with the \fB-p\fR filter
option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-J\fR \fIjob\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints \fIjob\fR as the \fIjob name\fR on the banner page of the output.
Enclose \fIjob\fR in double quotes if it contains blanks. If \fIjob\fR is not
specified, \fIfile\fR (or in the case of multiple files, the first \fIfile\fR
specified on the command line) is printed as the job name on the banner page of
the output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sends mail after \fIfile\fR has printed. See \fBmail\fR(1). By default, no mail
is sent upon normal completion of a print request.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR \fIdestination\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints \fIfile\fR on a specific printer or class of printers (see
\fBlpadmin\fR(1M)). Specify \fIdestination\fR using atomic, URI-style
(\fIscheme\fR\fB://\fR\fBendpoint\fR), or POSIX-style
(\fIserver\fR\fB:\fR\fIdestination\fR) names. See \fBprinters.conf\fR(4) for
information regarding destination names.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints files by reference rather than copying them. This means that files
should not be modified or removed until they have completed printing. This
option only prevents copying of files when the print queue is on the local
machine and the files are specified on the command line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fItitle\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints a title on the page header of the output. Enclose \fItitle\fR in double
quotes if it contains blanks. The \fB-T\fR option is ignored unless it is
specified with the \fB-p\fR filter option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR \fIcols\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints \fIfile\fR with pages of a specific width. \fIcols\fR indicates the
number of columns wide. The \fB-w\fR option is ignored unless it is specified
with the \fB-p\fR filter option.
.RE

.na
\fB\(mi\fB1\fR|\(mi\fB2\fR|\(mi\fB3\fR|\(mi\fB4\fR \fIfont\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Mounts the specified font in the font position \fB1\fR, \fB2\fR, \fB3\fR, or
\fB4\fR. Specify \fIfont\fR as a valid font name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB\(mi\fR \fIfilter_option\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Notifies the print spooler that \fIfile\fR is not a standard text file. Enables
the spooling daemon to use the appropriate filters to print \fIfile\fR.
.sp
\fIfilter_option\fRs offer a standard user interface. All filter options might
not be available for, or applicable to, all printers.
.sp
Specify \fIfilter_option\fR as a single character.
.sp
If \fIfilter_option\fR is not specified and the printer can interpret
PostScript\(rg, inserting `\fB%!\fR' as the first two characters of \fIfile\fR
causes \fIfile\fR to be interpreted as PostScript.
.sp
The following filter options are supported:

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlpr:\fR \fIdestination\fR \fB|: unknown destination\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
\fIdestination\fR was not found in the \fBLP\fR configuration database. Usually
this is a typing mistake; however, it can indicate that the \fIdestination\fR
does not exist on the system. Use \fBlpstat\fR \fB-p\fR to display information
about the status of the print service.
.RE

.SH NOTES
.LP
\fBlpr\fR is CSI-enabled except for the \fIprinter\fR name.
.sp
.LP
Print jobs are assumed to contain one type of data. That type of data is either
specified on the command line or autodetected (simple, PostScript) based on the
contents of the first file in the job.
.sp
.LP
When IPP is in use, the user is prompted for a passphrase if the remote print
service is configured to require authentication.
