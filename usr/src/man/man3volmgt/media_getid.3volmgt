.TH MEDIA_GETID 3VOLMGT "Mar 8, 2007"
.SH NAME
media_getid \- return the id of a piece of media
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc \fR[flag \&.\|.\|.] \fIfile \fR\&.\|.\|.\fB\(mil\fRvolmgt [library \&.\|.\|.]

#include <volmgt.h>



\fBulonglong_t\fR \fBmedia_getid\fR(\fBchar *\fR\fIvol_path\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume
Management feature, including \fBvold\fR, has been replaced by software that
supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL is
through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See
\fBhal\fR(5). The return value of this function is undefined.
.sp
.LP
\fBmedia_getid()\fR returns the \fIid\fR of a piece of media. Volume management
must be running. See \fBvolmgt_running\fR(3VOLMGT).
.SH PARAMETERS
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIvol_path\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
Path to the block or character special device.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
The return from this function is undefined.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBmedia_getid()\fR
.sp
.LP
The following example first checks if volume management is running, then checks
the volume management name space for \fIpath\fR, and then returns the \fIid\fR
for the piece of media.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
char *path;

	...

if (volmgt_running()) {
     if (volmgt_ownspath(path)) {
          (void) printf("id of %s is %lld\en",
               path, media_getid(path));
     }
	}
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
If a program using \fBmedia_getid()\fR does not check whether or not volume
management is running, then any \fBNULL\fR return value will be ambiguous, as
it could mean that either volume management does not have \fIpath\fR in its
name space, or volume management is not running.
