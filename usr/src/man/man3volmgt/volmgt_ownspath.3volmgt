A string containing the path.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume
Management feature, including \fBvold\fR, has been replaced by software that
supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL is
through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See
\fBhal\fR(5). The return value of this function is undefined.
.sp
.LP
The \fBvolmgt_ownspath()\fR function checks to see if a given \fIpath\fR is
contained in the volume management name space. This is achieved by comparing
the beginning of the supplied path name with the output from
\fBvolmgt_root\fR(3VOLMGT)
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
The return from this function is undefined.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBvolmgt_ownspath()\fR
.sp
.LP
The following example first checks if volume management is running, then checks
the volume management name space for \fIpath\fR, and then returns the \fIid\fR
for the piece of media.

char *path;

          (void) printf("id of %s is %lld\en",
               path, media_getid(path));
     }
