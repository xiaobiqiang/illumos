.SH NAME
bootfs \- boot-time module file system

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B bootfs
file system is a read-only file system that provides access to any
boot-time modules that were passed in to the system loader which were
tagged with the type
.IR file .
.B bootfs
does not display any boot-time modules that were tagged as type
.I hash
or type
.IR rootfs .

If modules with duplicate names and paths are specified, only the first
such entry will be present in the file system and a counter will be
incremented to indicate that a duplicate entry was found, but is not
present into the file system. If a module's name only consists of
invalid characters, such as '.', '..', or '/', then the module will not
be present in the file system and a counter will be incremented to
indicate that this has occurred. In both cases, diagnostic information
is available through the kstats facility.
