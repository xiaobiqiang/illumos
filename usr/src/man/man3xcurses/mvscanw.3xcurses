.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions are similar to \fBscanf\fR(3C). Their effect is as though
\fBmvwgetstr\fR(3XCURSES) were called to get a multi-byte character string from
the current or specified window at the current or specified cursor position,
and then \fBsscanf()\fR were used to interpret and convert that string.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return \fBOK\fR. Otherwise, they
return \fBERR\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
