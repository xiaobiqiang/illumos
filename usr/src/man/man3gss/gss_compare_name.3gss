.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_compare_name()\fR function allows an application to compare two
internal-form names to determine whether they refer to the same entity.
.sp
.LP
If either name presented to \fBgss_compare_name()\fR denotes an anonymous
principal, the routines indicate that the two names do not refer to the same
identity.
.SH PARAMETERS
.sp
.LP
The parameter descriptions for \fBgss_compare_name()\fR follow:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIminor_status\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Mechanism-specific status code.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Internal-form name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Internal-form name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname_equal\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
If non-zero, the names refer to same entity. If 0, the names refer to different
entities. Strictly, the names are not known to refer to the same identity.
.RE

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBgss_compare_name()\fR function may return the following status codes:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_COMPLETE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
The two names were of incomparable types.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_BAD_NAME\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
One or both of \fIname1\fR or \fIname2\fR was ill-formed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGSS_S_FAILURE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 22n
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific \fBGSS\fR
status code is defined.  The mechanism-specific status code reported by means
of the \fIminor_status\fR parameter details the error condition.
