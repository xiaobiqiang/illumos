.SH NAME
isless \- test if x is less than y
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBint\fR \fBisless\fR(\fBreal-floating\fR \fIx\fR, \fBreal-floating\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBisless()\fR macro determines whether its first argument is less than its
second argument.  The value of \fBisless\fR(\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR) is equal to
(\fIx\fR) < (\fIy\fR); however, unlike (\fIx\fR) < (\fIy\fR),
\fBisless\fR(\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR) does not raise the invalid floating-point
exception when \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR are unordered.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBisless()\fR macro returns the value of
(\fIx\fR) < (\fIy\fR).
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR or \fIy\fR is NaN, 0 is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The relational and equality operators support the usual mathematical
relationships between numeric values. For any ordered pair of numeric values,
exactly one of the relationships (less, greater, and equal) is true. Relational
operators can raise the invalid floating-point exception when argument values
are NaNs. For a NaN and a numeric value, or for two NaNs, just the unordered
relationship is true. This macro is a quiet (non-floating-point exception
raising) version of a relational operator. It facilitates writing efficient
code that accounts for quiet NaNs without suffering the invalid floating-point
exception. In the \fBSYNOPSIS\fR section, \fBreal-floating\fR indicates that
the argument is an expression of \fBreal-floating\fR type.
