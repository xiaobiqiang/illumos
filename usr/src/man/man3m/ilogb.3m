.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions return the exponent part of their argument \fIx\fR.  Formally,
the return value is the integral part of  \fBlog\fR(r)| \fIx\fR | as a signed
integral value, for non-zero \fIx\fR, where \fIr\fR is the radix of the
machine's floating point arithmetic, which is the value of \fBFLT_RADIX\fR
defined in <\fBfloat.h\fR>.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return the exponent part of \fIx\fR
as a signed integer value. They are equivalent to calling the corresponding
\fBlogb\fR(3M) function and casting the returned value to type \fBint\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is 0, the value \fBFP_ILOGB0\fR is returned. For SUSv3-conforming
applications compiled with the \fBc99\fR compiler driver (see
\fBstandards\fR(5)), a domain error occurs.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(+-Inf, the value \fBINT_MAX\fR is returned. For
SUSv3-conforming applications compiled with the \fBc99\fR compiler driver, a
domain error occurs.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is NaN, the value \fBFP_ILOGBNAN\fR is returned. For
SUSv3-conforming applications compiled with the \fBc99\fR compiler driver, a
domain error occurs.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDomain Error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The \fIx\fR argument is zero, NaN, or \(+-Inf.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception is raised.
