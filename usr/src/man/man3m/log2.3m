.TH LOG2 3M "Jul 12, 2006" "SunOS 5.11" "Mathematical Library Functions"
.SH NAME
log2, log2f, log2l \- compute base 2 logarithm functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBlog2\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBlog2f\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBlog2l\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions compute the base 2 logarithm of their argument \fIx\fR,
\fBlog2\fR(\fIx\fR).
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return the base 2 logarithm of
\fIx\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(+-0, a pole error occurs and \fBlog2()\fR, \fBlog2f()\fR, and
\fBlog2l()\fR return \(mi\fBHUGE_VAL\fR, \(mi\fBHUGE_VALF\fR, and
\(mi\fBHUGE_VALL\fR, respectively.
.sp
.LP
For finite values of \fIx\fR that are less than 0,  or if \fIx\fR is \(miInf a
domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is 1, +0 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is +Inf, \fIx\fR is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDomain Error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The finite value of \fIx\fR is less than 0, or \fIx\fR is \(miInf.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception is raised.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBPole Error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The value of \fIx\fR is 0.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception is raised.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call
\fBfeclearexcept\fR(\fBFE_ALL_EXCEPT\fR) before calling these functions. On
return, if \fBfetestexcept\fR(\fBFE_INVALID\fR | \fBFE_DIVBYZERO\fR |
\fBFE_OVERFLOW\fR | \fBFE_UNDERFLOW\fR) is non-zero, an exception has been
raised. An application should either examine the return value or check the
floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
