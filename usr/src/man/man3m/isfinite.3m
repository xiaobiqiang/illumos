.SH NAME
isfinite \- test for finite value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBint\fR \fBisfinite\fR(\fBreal-floating\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBisfinite()\fR macro determines whether its argument has a finite value
(zero, subnormal, or normal, and not infinite or NaN). First, an argument
represented in a format wider than its semantic type is converted to its
semantic type. Then determination is based on the type of the argument.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBisfinite()\fR macro returns a non-zero value if and only if its argument
has a finite value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
