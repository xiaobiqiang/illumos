.TH FEGETROUND 3M "Jul 12, 2006" "SunOS 5.11" "Mathematical Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fegetround, fesetround \- get and set current rounding direction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <fenv.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The fegetround function gets the current rounding direction.
.sp
.LP
The fesetround function establishes the rounding direction represented by its
argument round. If the argument is not equal to the value of a rounding
direction macro, the rounding direction is not changed.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The fegetround function returns the value of the rounding direction macro
representing the current rounding direction, or a negative value if there is no
such rounding direction macro or the current rounding direction is not
determinable.
.sp
.LP
The fesetround function returns a 0 value if and only if the requested rounding
direction was established.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
The following example saves, sets, and restores the rounding direction,
reporting an error and aborting if setting the rounding direction fails:
