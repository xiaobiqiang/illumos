.SH NAME
exp, expf, expl \- exponential function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBexp\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBexpf\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBexpl\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions compute the base-\fIe\fR exponential of \fIx\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return the exponential value of
\fIx\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error occurs and
\fBexp()\fR, \fBexpf()\fR, and \fBexpl()\fR return \fBHUGE_VAL\fR,
\fBHUGE_VALF\fR, and \fBHUGE_VALL\fR, respectively.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(+-0, 1 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is +Inf, \fIx\fR is returned.
.sp
.LP
For exceptional cases, \fBmatherr\fR(3M) tabulates the values to be returned by
\fBexp()\fR as specified by SVID3 and XPG3. See \fBstandards\fR(5).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBRange Error\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
.rt
The result overflows.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, the overflow floating-point exception is raised.
.sp
The \fBexp()\fR function sets \fBerrno\fR to \fBERANGE\fR if the result
overflows.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call
\fBfeclearexcept\fR(\fBFE_ALL_EXCEPT\fR) before calling these functions. On
return, if \fBfetestexcept\fR(\fBFE_INVALID\fR | \fBFE_DIVBYZERO\fR |
\fBFE_OVERFLOW\fR | \fBFE_UNDERFLOW\fR) is non-zero, an exception has been
raised. An application should either examine the return value or check the
floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
.sp
.LP
An application can also set \fBerrno\fR to 0 before calling \fBexp()\fR. On
return, if \fBerrno\fR is non-zero, an error has occurred. The \fBexpf()\fR and
\fBexpl()\fR functions do not set \fBerrno\fR.
