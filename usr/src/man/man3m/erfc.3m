.SH NAME
erfc, erfcf, erfcl \- complementary error function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBerfc\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR);

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBerfcf\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR);

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBerfcl\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These function compute the complementary error function 1.0 \(mi
\fBerf(\fR\fIx\fR\fB).\fR
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return the value of the
complementary error function.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(+-0, +1 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(miInf, +2 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is +Inf, 0 is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBerfc()\fR function is provided because of the extreme loss of relative
accuracy if \fBerf(\fR\fIx\fR\fB)\fR is called for large \fIx\fR and the result
subtracted from 1.0.
