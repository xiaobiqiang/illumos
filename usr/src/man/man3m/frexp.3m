.SH NAME
frexp, frexpf, frexpl \- extract mantissa and exponent from a floating-point
number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBfrexp\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fInum\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIexp\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBfrexpf\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fInum\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIexp\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBfrexpl\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fInum\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIexp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions break a floating-point number into a normalized fraction and an
integral power of 2. They store the integer exponent in the \fBint\fR object
pointed to by \fIexp\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
For finite arguments, these functions return the value \fIx\fR, such that
\fIx\fR is a \fBdouble\fR with magnitude in the interval [\(12, 1) or 0, and
\fInum\fR equals \fIx\fR times 2 raised to the power *\fIexp\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fInum\fR is NaN, NaN is returned and the value of *\fIexp\fR is
unspecified.
.sp
.LP
If \fInum\fR is \(+- 0, \(+- 0 is returned and the value of *\fIexp\fR is 0.
.sp
.LP
If \fInum\fR is \(+-Inf, \fInum\fR is returned and the value of *\fIexp\fR is
unspecified.
