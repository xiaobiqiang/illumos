.SH NAME
feholdexcept \- save current floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <fenv.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfeholdexcept\fR(\fBfenv_t *\fR\fIenvp\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfeholdexcept()\fR function saves the current floating-point environment
in the object pointed to by \fIenvp\fR, clears the floating-point status flags,
and then installs a non-stop (continue on floating-point exceptions) mode, if
available, for all floating-point exceptions.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBfeholdexcept()\fR function returns 0 if and only if non-stop
floating-point exception handling was successfully installed.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
.SH ATTRIBUTES

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
In a multithreaded program, the \fBfeholdexcept()\fR function affects the
floating point environment only for the calling thread.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfeholdexcept()\fR function automatically installs and deinstalls
\fBSIGFPE\fR handlers and sets and clears the trap enable mode bits in the
floating point status register as needed. If a program uses these functions and
attempts to install a \fBSIGFPE\fR handler or control the trap enable mode bits
independently, the resulting behavior is not defined.
