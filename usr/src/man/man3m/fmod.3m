.SH NAME
fmod, fmodf, fmodl \- floating-point remainder value function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBfmod\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR, \fBdouble\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBfmodf\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR, \fBfloat\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBfmodl\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR, \fBlong double\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions return the floating-point remainder of the division of \fIx\fR
by \fIy\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
These functions return the value \fIx\fR \(mi \fIi\fR * \fIy\fR, for some
integer \fIi\fR such that, if \fIy\fR is non-zero, the result has the same sign
as \fIx\fR and magnitude less than the magnitude of \fIy\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR or \fIy\fR is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIy\fR is 0, a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is infinite, a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(+-0 and \fIy\fR is not 0, \(+-0 is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is not infinite and \fIy\fR is \(+-Inf, \fIx\fR is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDomain Error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The \fIx\fR argument is infinite or \fIy\fR is 0.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, the invalid floating-point exception is raised.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call
\fBfeclearexcept\fR(\fBFE_ALL_EXCEPT\fR) before calling these functions. On
return, if \fBfetestexcept\fR(\fBFE_INVALID\fR | \fBFE_DIVBYZERO\fR |
\fBFE_OVERFLOW\fR | \fBFE_UNDERFLOW\fR) is non-zero, an exception has been
raised. An application should either examine the return value or check the
floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
