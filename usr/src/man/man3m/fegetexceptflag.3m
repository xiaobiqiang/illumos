.TH FEGETEXCEPTFLAG 3M "Sep 1, 2002" "SunOS 5.11" "Mathematical Library Functions"
.SH NAME
fegetexceptflag, fesetexceptflag \- get and set floating-point status flags
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <fenv.h>

\fBint\fR \fBfegetexceptflag\fR(\fBfexcept_t *\fR\fIflagp\fR, \fBint\fR \fIexcepts\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBfesetexceptflag\fR(\fBconst fexcept_t *\fR\fIflagp\fR, \fBint\fR \fIexcepts\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfegetexceptflag()\fR function attempts to store an
implementation-defined representation of the states of the floating-point
status flags indicated by the \fIexcepts\fR argument in the object pointed to
by the \fIflagp\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfesetexceptflag()\fR function attempts to set the floating-point status
flags indicated by the \fIexcepts\fR argument to the states stored in the
object pointed to by \fIflagp\fR. The value pointed to by \fIflagp\fR will have
been set by a previous call to \fBfegetexceptflag()\fR whose second argument
represented at least those floating-point exceptions represented by the
\fIexcepts\fR argument. This function does not raise floating-point exceptions
but only sets the state of the flags.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If the representation was successfully stored, \fBfegetexceptflag()\fR returns
0. Otherwise, it returns a non-zero value.
.sp
.LP
If the excepts argument is 0 or if all the specified exceptions were
successfully set, \fBfesetexceptflag()\fR returns 0. Otherwise, it returns a
non-zero value.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
No errors are defined.
