.TH REMQUO 3M "Jul 12, 2006" "SunOS 5.11" "Mathematical Library Functions"
.SH NAME
remquo, remquof, remquol \- remainder functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBremquo\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR, \fBdouble\fR \fIy\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIquo\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBfloat\fR \fBremquof\fR(\fBfloat\fR \fIx\fR, \fBfloat\fR \fIy\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIquo\fR);
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBremquol\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR, \fBlong double\fR \fIy\fR, \fBint *\fR\fIquo\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBremquo()\fR, \fBremquof()\fR, and \fBremquol()\fR functions compute the
same remainder as the \fBremainder()\fR, \fBremainderf()\fR, and
\fBremainderl()\fR functions, respectively. See \fBremainder\fR(3M). In the
object pointed to by \fIquo\fR, they store a value whose sign is the sign of
\fIx\fR/\fIy\fR and whose magnitude is congruent modulo 2^\fIn\fR to the
magnitude of the integral quotient of \fIx\fR/\fIy\fR, where \fIn\fR is an
integer greater than or equal to 3.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
These functions return \fIx\fR REM \fIy\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR or \fIy\fR is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is \(+-Inf or \fIy\fR is 0 and the other argument is non-NaN, a
domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDomain Error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The \fIx\fR argument is Inf or the \fIy\fR argument is 0 and the other argument
is non-NaN.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception is raised.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call
\fBfeclearexcept\fR(\fBFE_ALL_EXCEPT\fR) before calling these functions. On
return, if \fBfetestexcept\fR(\fBFE_INVALID\fR | \fBFE_DIVBYZERO\fR |
\fBFE_OVERFLOW\fR | \fBFE_UNDERFLOW\fR) is non-zero, an exception has been
raised. An application should either examine the return value or check the
floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
