.SH NAME
remainder, remainderf, remainderl \- remainder function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
c99 [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... \fB-lm\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <math.h>

\fBdouble\fR \fBremainder\fR(\fBdouble\fR \fIx\fR, \fBdouble\fR \fIy\fR);

.LP

.LP
.nf
\fBlong double\fR \fBremainderl\fR(\fBlong double\fR \fIx\fR, \fBlong double\fR \fIy\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
These functions return the floating point remainder \fIr\fR = \fIx\fR \(mi
\fIn\fR\fIy\fR when \fIy\fR is non-zero. The value \fIn\fR is the integral
value nearest the exact value \fIx\fR/\fIy\fR. When |\fIn\fR \(mi
\fIx\fR/\fIy\fR\|| = \(12, the value \fIn\fR is chosen to be even.
.sp
.LP
The behavior of \fBremainder()\fR is independent of the rounding mode.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions return the floating point remainder
\fIr\fR = \fIx\fR \(mi \fIn\fR\fIy\fR when \fIy\fR is non-zero.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR or \fIy\fR is NaN, a NaN is returned.
.sp
.LP
If \fIx\fR is infinite or \fIy\fR is 0 and the other is non-NaN, a domain error
occurs and a NaN is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
These functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBDomain Error\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
.rt
The \fIx\fR argument is \(+-Inf, or the \fIy\fR argument is \(+-0 and the other
argument is non-NaN.
.sp
If the integer expression (\fBmath_errhandling\fR & \fBMATH_ERREXCEPT\fR) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception is raised.
.sp
The \fBremainder()\fR function sets \fBerrno\fR to \fBEDOM\fR if \fIy\fR
argument is 0 or the \fIx\fR argument is positive or negative infinity.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
An application wanting to check for error situations can set \fBerrno\fR to 0
before calling \fBremainder()\fR. On return, if \fBerrno\fR is non-zero, an
error has occurred. The \fBremainderf()\fR and \fBremainderl()\fR functions do
not set \fBerrno\fR.
