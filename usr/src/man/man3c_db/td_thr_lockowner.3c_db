.TH TD_THR_LOCKOWNER 3C_DB "Oct 20, 1998"
.SH NAME
td_thr_lockowner \- iterate over the set of locks owned by a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lc_db [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <proc_service.h>
#include <thread_db.h>

\fBtd_err_e\fR \fBtd_thr_lockowner\fR(\fBconst td_thrhandle_t *\fR\fIth_p\fR, \fBtd_sync_iter_f *\fR\fIcb\fR,
     \fBvoid *\fR\fIcb_data_p\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBtd_thr_lockowner()\fR function calls the iterator function \fIcb\fR once
for every mutex that is held by the thread whose handle is \fIth_p\fR. The
synchronization handle and the pointer \fIcb_data_p\fR are passed to the
function. See \fBtd_ta_thr_iter\fR(3C_DB) for a similarly structured function.
.sp
.LP
Iteration terminates early if the callback function \fIcb\fR returns a non-zero
value.
