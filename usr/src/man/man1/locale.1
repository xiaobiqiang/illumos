.TH LOCALE 1 "Nov 28, 2017"
.SH NAME
locale \- get locale-specific information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBlocale\fR [\fB-a\fR | \fB-m\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBlocale\fR [\fB-ck\fR] \fIname\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlocale\fR utility writes information about the current locale
environment, or all public locales, to the standard output. For the purposes of
this section, a \fIpublic locale\fR is one provided by the implementation that
is accessible to the application.
.sp
.LP
When \fBlocale\fR is invoked without any arguments, it summarizes the current
locale environment for each locale category as determined by the settings of
the environment variables.
.sp
.LP
When invoked with operands, it writes values that have been assigned to the
keywords in the locale categories, as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Specifying a keyword name selects the named keyword and the category containing
that keyword.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Specifying a category name selects the named category and all keywords in that
category.
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Writes information about all available public locales. The available locales
include \fBPOSIX\fR, representing the POSIX locale.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Writes the names of selected locale categories. The \fB-c\fR option increases
readability when more than one category is selected (for example, via more than
one keyword name or via a category name). It is valid both with and without the
\fB-k\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Writes the names and values of selected keywords. The implementation may omit
values for some keywords; see OPERANDS.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Writes names of available charmaps; see  \fBlocaledef\fR(1).
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
The name of a locale category, the name of a keyword in a locale category, or
the reserved name \fBcharmap\fR. The named category or keyword will be selected
for output. If a single \fIname\fR represents both a locale category name and a
keyword name in the current locale, the results are unspecified; otherwise,
both category and keyword names can be specified as \fIname\fR operands, in any
sequence.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRExamples of the locale utility
.sp
.LP
In the following examples, the assumption is that locale environment variables
are set as follows:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
LANG=locale_x LC_COLLATE=locale_y
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The command \fBlocale\fR would result in the following output:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
LANG=locale_x
LC_CTYPE="locale_x"
LC_NUMERIC="locale_x"
LC_TIME="locale_x"
LC_COLLATE=locale_y
LC_MONETARY="locale_x"
LC_MESSAGES="locale_x"
LC_ALL=
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The command

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBLC_ALL=POSIX locale -ck decimal_point\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
would produce:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
LC_NUMERIC
decimal_point="."
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following command shows an application of \fBlocale\fR to determine whether
a user-supplied response is affirmative:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBif printf "%s\en" "$response" | /usr/bin/grep -Eq\e
        "$(locale yesexpr)"
then
    affirmative processing goes here
else
    non-affirmative processing goes here
fi\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for the descriptions of  \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_*\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR environment variables must
specify the current locale environment to be written out. These environment
variables will be used if the \fB-a\fR option is not specified.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
All the requested information was found and output successfully.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
An error occurred.
.RE

.SH NOTES
.LP
If \fBLC_CTYPE\fR or keywords in the category \fBLC_CTYPE\fR are specified,
only the values in the range \fB0x00\fR-\fB0x7f\fR are written out.
.sp
.LP
If \fBLC_COLLATE\fR or keywords in the category \fBLC_COLLATE\fR are specified,
no actual values are written out.
