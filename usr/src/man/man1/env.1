.TH ENV 1 "Jan 2, 2002"
.SH NAME
env \- set environment for command invocation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/env\fR [\fB-i\fR | \fB-\fR] [\fIname=value\fR]... [\fIutility\fR [\fIarg\fR... ]]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/xpg4/bin/env\fR [\fB-i\fR | \fB-\fR] [\fIname=value\fR]...
     [\fIutility\fR [\fIarg\fR... ]]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBenv\fR utility obtains the current environment, modifies it according to
its arguments, then invokes the utility named by the \fIutility\fR operand with
the modified environment.
.sp
.LP
Optional arguments are passed to \fIutility\fR. If no \fIutility\fR operand is
specified, the resulting environment is written to the standard output, with
one \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR pair per line.
.sp
.LP
If \fBenv\fR executes commands with arguments, it uses the default shell
\fB/usr/bin/sh\fR (see \fBsh\fR(1)).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR | \fB\(mi\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Ignores the environment that would otherwise be inherited from the current
shell.  Restricts the environment for \fIutility\fR to that specified by the
arguments.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Arguments of the form \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR modify the execution
environment, and are placed into the inherited environment before \fIutility\fR
is invoked.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIutility\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
The name of the utility to be invoked.  If \fIutility\fR names any of the
special shell built-in utilities, the results are undefined.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIarg\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
A string to pass as an argument for the invoked utility.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRInvoking utilities with new PATH values
.sp
.LP
The following utility:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBenv -i PATH=/mybin mygrep xyz myfile \fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
invokes the utility \fBmygrep\fR with a new \fBPATH\fR value as the only entry
in its environment. In this case, \fBPATH\fR is used to locate \fBmygrep\fR,
which then must reside in \fB/mybin\fR.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBenv\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBPATH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
Determine the location of the \fIutility\fR. If \fBPATH\fR is specified as a
\fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR operand to \fBenv\fR, the value given shall be used in
the search for \fIutility\fR.
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
If \fIutility\fR is invoked, the exit status of \fBenv\fR is the exit status of
\fIutility\fR. Otherwise, the \fBenv\fR utility returns one of the following
exit values:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB1-125\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
An error occurred.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB126\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fIutility\fR was found but could not be invoked.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB127\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fIutility\fR could not be found.
