.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In the first synopsis form, neither \fIsource_file\fR nor \fItarget_file\fR are
directory files, nor can they have the same name. The \fBcp\fR utility copies
the contents of \fIsource_file\fR to the destination path named by
\fItarget_file\fR. If \fItarget_file\fR exists, \fBcp\fR overwrites its
contents, but the mode (and \fBACL\fR if applicable), owner, and group
associated with it are not changed. The last modification time of
\fItarget_file\fR and the last access time of \fIsource_file\fR are set to the
time the copy was made. If \fItarget_file\fR does not exist, \fBcp\fR creates a
new file named \fItarget_file\fR that has the same mode as \fIsource_file\fR
except that the sticky bit is not set unless the user is super-user. In this
case, the owner and group of \fItarget_file\fR are those of the user, unless
the setgid bit is set on the directory containing the newly created file. If
the directory's setgid bit is set, the newly created file has the group of the
containing directory rather than of the creating user. If \fItarget_file\fR is
a link to another file, \fBcp\fR overwrites the link destination with the
contents of \fIsource_file\fR; the link(s) from \fItarget_file\fR remains.
.sp
.LP
In the second synopsis form, one or more \fIsource_file\fRs are copied to the
directory specified by \fItarget\fR. It is an error if any \fIsource_file\fR is
a file of type directory, if \fItarget\fR either does not exist or is not a
directory.
.sp
.LP
In the third or fourth synopsis forms, one or more directories specified by
\fIsource_dir\fR are copied to the directory specified by \fItarget\fR. Either
the \fB-r\fR or \fB-R\fR must be specified. For each \fIsource_dir\fR, \fBcp\fR
copies all files and subdirectories.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for both \fB/usr/bin/cp\fR and
\fB/usr/xpg4/bin/cp\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Archive mode. Same as -RpP.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Unlink. If a file descriptor for a destination file cannot be obtained, this
option attempts to unlink the destination file and proceed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Takes actions based on the type and contents of the file referenced by any
symbolic link specified as a \fIsource_file\fR operand.
.sp
If the \fIsource_file\fR operand is a symbolic link, then \fBcp\fR copies the
file referenced by the symbolic link for the \fIsource_file\fR operand. All
other symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy are
preserved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Interactive. \fBcp\fR prompts for confirmation whenever the copy would
overwrite an existing \fItarget\fR. An affirmative response means that the copy
should proceed. Any other answer prevents \fBcp\fR from overwriting
\fItarget\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Takes actions based on the type and contents of the file referenced by any
symbolic link specified as a \fIsource_file\fR operand or any symbolic links
encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy.
.sp
Copies files referenced by symbolic links. Symbolic links encountered during
traversal of a file hierarchy are not preserved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Preserve. The \fBcp\fR utility duplicates not only the contents of
\fIsource_file\fR, but also attempts to preserve its ACL, access and
modification times, extended attributes, extended system attributes, file mode,
and owner and group ids.
.sp
If \fBcp\fR is unable to preserve the access and modification times, extended
attributes, or the file mode, \fBcp\fR does not consider it a failure. If
\fBcp\fR is unable to preserve the owner and group id, the copy does not fail,
but \fBcp\fR silently clears the \fBS_ISUID\fR and \fBS_ISGID\fR bits from the
file mode of the target. The copy fails if \fBcp\fR is unable to clear these
bits. If \fBcp\fR is unable to preserve the ACL or extended system attributes,
the copy fails. If the copy fails, then a diagnostic message is written to
\fBstderr\fR and (after processing any remaining operands) \fBcp\fR exits with
a \fBnon-zero\fR exit status.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Takes actions on any symbolic link specified as a \fIsource_file\fR operand or
any symbolic link encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy.
.sp
Copies symbolic links. Symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file
hierarchy are preserved.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Recursive. \fBcp\fR copies the directory and all its files, including any
subdirectories and their files to \fItarget\fR. Unless the \fB-H\fR, \fB-L\fR,
or \fB-P\fR option is specified, the \fB-L\fR option is used as the default
mode.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Same as \fB-r\fR, except pipes are replicated, not read from.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-@\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Preserves extended attributes. \fBcp\fR attempts to copy all of the source
file's extended attributes along with the file data to the destination file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-/\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Preserves extended attributes and extended system attributes. Along with the
file's data, the \fBcp\fR utility attempts to copy extended attributes and
extended system attributes from each source file, and extended system
attributes associated with extended attributes to the destination file. If
\fBcp\fR is unable to copy extended attributes or extended system attributes,
then a diagnostic message is written to \fBstderr\fR and (after processing any
remaining operands) exits with a \fBnon-zero\fR exit status.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options \fB-H\fR, \fB-L\fR,
and \fB-P\fR is not considered an error. The last option specified determines
the behavior of the utility.
.SS "/usr/bin/cp"
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-p\fR option is specified with either the \fB-@\fR option or the
\fB-/\fR option, \fB/usr/bin/cp\fR behaves as follows
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When both \fB-p\fR and \fB-@\fR are specified in any order, the copy fails if
extended attributes cannot be copied.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu

When both \fB-p\fR and \fB-/\fR are specified in any order, the copy fails if
extended system attributes cannot be copied.

.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/cp"
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-p\fR option is specified with either the \fB-@\fR option or the
\fB-/\fR option, /\fBusr/xpg4/bin/cp\fR behaves as follows:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When both \fB-p\fR and \fB-@\fR are specified, the last option specified
determines whether the copy fails if extended attributes cannot be preserved.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
When both \fB-p\fR and \fB-/\fR are specified, the last option specified

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBcp\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.sp
.LP
Affirmative responses are processed using the extended regular expression
defined for the \fByesexpr\fR keyword in the \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR category of the
user's locale. The locale specified in the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR category defines
the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
elements used in the expression defined for \fByesexpr\fR. The locale specified
in \fBLC_CTYPE\fR determines the locale for interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data a characters, the behavior of character classes used in the
expression defined for the \fByesexpr\fR. See \fBlocale\fR(5).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n

.sp
.LP
The permission modes of the source file are preserved in the copy.

A \fB--\fR permits the user to mark the end of any command line options
explicitly, thus allowing \fBcp\fR to recognize filename arguments that begin
with a \fB-\fR.
