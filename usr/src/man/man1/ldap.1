.SH NAME
ldap \- LDAP as a naming repository
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
LDAP refers to Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, which is an industry
standard for accessing directory servers. By initializing the client using
\fBldapclient\fR(1M) and using the keyword \fBldap\fR in the name service
switch file, \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR, Solaris clients can obtain naming
information from an LDAP server. Information such as usernames, hostnames, and
passwords are stored on the LDAP server in a Directory Information Tree or
\fBDIT\fR. The \fBDIT\fR consists of entries which in turn are composed of
attributes. Each attribute has a type and one or more values.
.sp
.LP
Solaris LDAP clients use the LDAP v3 protocol to access naming information from
LDAP servers. The LDAP server must support the object classes and attributes
defined in \fIRFC2307bis (draft)\fR, which maps the naming service model on to
LDAP. As an alternate to using the schema defined in \fIRFC2307bis (draft)\fR,
the system can be configured to use other schema sets and the schema mapping
feature is configured to map between the two. Refer to the \fISystem
Administration Guide: Naming and Directory Services (DNS, NIS, and LDAP)\fR for
more details.
.sp
.LP
The \fBldapclient\fR(1M) utility can make a Solaris machine an LDAP client by
setting up the appropriate directories, files, and configuration information.
The LDAP client caches this configuration information in local cache files.
This configuration information is accessed through the \fBldap_cachemgr\fR(1M)
daemon. This daemon also refreshes the information in the configuration files
from the LDAP server, providing better performance and security. The
\fBldap_cachemgr\fR must run at all times for the proper operation of the
naming services.
.sp
.LP
There are two types of configuration information, the information available
through a profile, and the information configured per client. The profile
contains all the information as to how the client accesses the directory. The
credential information for proxy user is configured on a per client basis and
is not downloaded through the profile.
.sp
.LP
The profile contains server-specific parameters that are required by all
clients to locate the servers for the desired LDAP domain. This information
could be the server's IP address and the search base Distinguished Name (DN),
for instance. It is configured on the client from the default profile during
client initialization and is periodically updated by the \fBldap_cachemgr\fR
daemon when the expiration time has elapsed.
.sp
.LP
Client profiles can be stored on the LDAP server and can be used by the
\fBldapclient\fR utility to initialize an LDAP client. Using the client profile
is the easiest way to configure a client machine. See \fBldapclient\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
Credential information includes client-specific parameters that are used by a
client. This information could be the Bind DN (LDAP "login" name) of the client
and the password. If these parameters are required, they are manually defined
during the initialization through \fBldapclient\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
The naming information is stored in containers on the LDAP server. A container
is a non-leaf entry in the DIT that contains naming service information.
Containers are similar to maps in NIS. A default mapping
between the NIS databases and the containers in LDAP is presented below. The
location of these containers as well as their names can be overridden through
the use of \fBserviceSearchDescriptors\fR. For more information, see
\fBldapclient\fR(1M).

The security model for clients is defined by a combination of the credential
level to be used, the authentication method, and the PAM modules to be used.
The credential level defines what credentials the client should use to
authenticate to the directory server, and the authentication method defines the
method of choice. Both these can be set with multiple values. The Solaris LDAP
supports the following values for credential level :
.br
.in +2
\fBanonymous\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBproxy\fR
.in -2
.br
.in +2
\fBself\fR
.in -2

The Solaris LDAP supports the following values for authentication method:
.br

\fBnone\fR

\fBsimple\fR

.sp
.LP
When the credential level is configured as \fBself\fR, DNS must be configured
and the authentication method must be \fBsasl/GSSAPI\fR. The \fBhosts\fR and
\fBipnodes\fR in \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR must be configured to use DNS, for
example \fBhosts: dns files\fR and \fBipnodes: dns files\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBsasl/GSSAPI\fR automatically uses \fBGSSAPI\fR confidentiality and integrity
options, if they are configured on the directory server.
.sp
.LP
The credential level of \fBself\fR enables per-user naming service lookups, or
lookups that use the \fBGSSAPI\fR credentials of the user when connecting to
the directory server. Currently the only \fBGSSAPI\fR mechanism supported in
this model is Kerberos V5. Kerberos must be configured before you can use this
credential level. See \fBkerberos\fR(5) for details.
.sp
.LP
More protection can be provided by means of access control, allowing the server
to grant access for certain containers or entries. Access control is specified
by Access Control Lists (ACLs) that are defined and stored in the LDAP server.
The Access Control Lists on the LDAP server are called Access Control
Instructions (ACIs) by the SunOne Directory Server. Each ACL or ACI
specifies one or more directory objects, for example, the \fBcn\fR attribute in
a specific container, one or more clients to whom you grant or deny access, and
one or more access rights that determine what the clients can do to or with the
objects. Clients can be users or applications. Access rights can be specified
as read and write, for example. Refer to the \fISystem Administration Guide:
Naming and Directory Services (DNS, NIS, and LDAP)\fR regarding the
restrictions on ACLs and ACIs when using LDAP as a naming repository.
.sp
.LP
A sample \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) file called \fBnsswitch.ldap\fR is provided in
the \fB/etc\fR directory. This is copied to \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR by the
\fBldapclient\fR(1M) utility. This file uses LDAP as a repository for the
different databases in the \fBnsswitch.conf\fR file.
