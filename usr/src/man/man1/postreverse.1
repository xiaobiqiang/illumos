.SH NAME
postreverse \- reverse the page order in a PostScript file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpostreverse\fR [\fB-o\fR \fIlist\fR] [\fB-r\fR] [\fIfile\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/lp/postscript/postreverse\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBpostreverse\fR filter reverses the page order in files that conform to
Adobe's Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 file structuring conventions, and writes the
results on the standard output. Only one input \fBfile\fR is allowed and if no
\fBfile\fR is specified, the standard input is read.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpostreverse\fR filter can handle a limited class of files that violate
page independence, provided all global definitions are bracketed by
\fB%%BeginGlobal\fR and \fB%%EndGlobal\fR comments. In addition, files that
mark the end of each page with \fB%%EndPage: label ordinal\fR comments will
also reverse properly, provided the prologue and trailer sections can be
located. If \fBpostreverse\fR fails to find an \fB%%EndProlog\fR or
\fB%%EndSetup\fR comment, the entire \fBfile\fR is copied, unmodified, to the
standard output.
.sp
.LP
Because global definitions are extracted from individual pages and put in the
prologue, the output file can be minimally conforming, even if the input
\fBfile\fR was not.
.SH OPTIONS
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fI list\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Select pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated \fIlist\fR. The
\fIlist\fR contains single numbers \fIN\fR and ranges \fIN1 \fR\(mi \fIN2\fR. A
missing \fIN1\fR means the lowest numbered page, a missing \fIN2\fR means the
highest. The page range is an expression of logical pages rather than physical
sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two logical pages to a sheet,
and you specified a range of \fB4\fR, then two sheets of paper would print,
containing four page layouts. If you specified a page range of \fB3-4\fR, when
requesting two logical pages to a sheet; then \fIonly\fR page 3 and page 4
layouts would print, and they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.

.SH EXAMPLES

\fBExample 1 \fRExamples of \fBpostreverse\fR.
.sp
.LP
o select pages 1 to 100 from \fBfile\fR and reverse the pages:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% postreverse \fR\fB-o1\fR\fB\(mi100 \fR\fBfile\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To print four logical pages on each physical page and reverse all the pages:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% postprint \fR\fB-n4\fR\fB \fR\fBfile\fR | postreverse
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
To produce a minimally conforming file from output generated by \fBdpost\fR
without reversing the pages:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBexample% dpost \fR\fBfile\fR | postreverse \fB-r\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
Successful completion.

.SH NOTES
.LP
No attempt has been made to deal with redefinitions of global variables or
procedures. If standard input is used, the input \fBfile\fR will be read three
times before being reversed.
