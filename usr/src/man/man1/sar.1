.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
In the first instance, the \fBsar\fR utility samples cumulative activity
counters in the operating system at \fIn\fR intervals of \fIt\fR seconds, where
\fIt\fR should be \fB5\fR or greater. If \fIt\fR is specified with more than
one option, all headers are printed together and the output can be difficult to
read. (If the sampling interval is less than \fB5\fR, the activity of \fBsar\fR
itself can affect the sample.) If the \fB-o\fR option is specified, it saves
the samples in \fIfilename\fR in binary format. The default value of \fIn\fR is
\fB1\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the second instance, no sampling interval is specified. \fBsar\fR extracts
data from a previously recorded \fIfilename\fR, either the one specified by the
\fB-f\fR option or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file
\fB/var/adm/sa/sa\fIdd\fR\fR for the current day \fIdd\fR. The starting and
ending times of the report can be bounded using the \fB-e\fR and \fB-s\fR
arguments with \fItime\fR specified in the form \fIhh\fR[:\fImm\fR[:\fIss\fR]].
The \fB-i\fR option selects records at \fIsec\fR second intervals. Otherwise,
all intervals found in the data file are reported.
