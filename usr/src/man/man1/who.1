.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBwho\fR utility can list the user's name, terminal line, login time,
elapsed time since activity occurred on the line, and the process-ID of the
command interpreter (shell) for each current UNIX system user. It examines the
\fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR file to obtain its information. If \fIfile\fR is given,
that file (which must be in \fButmpx\fR(4) format) is examined. Usually,
\fIfile\fR will be \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR, which contains a history of all the
logins since the file was last created.

The general format for output is:

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Processes \fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR or the named \fIfile\fR with \fB-b\fR, \fB-d\fR,
\fB-l\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-r\fR, \fB-t\fR, \fB-T\fR, and \fB-u\fR options turned
on.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Indicates the time and date of the last reboot.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Displays all processes that have expired and not been respawned by \fBinit\fR.
The \fBexit\fR field appears for dead processes and contains the termination
and exit values of the dead process. This
can be useful in determining why a process terminated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Outputs column headings above the regular output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Lists only those lines on which the system is waiting for someone to login. The
\fIname\fR field is \fBLOGIN\fR in such cases. Other fields are the same as for
user entries except that the \fIstate\fR field does not exist.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Outputs only information about the current terminal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIx\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Takes a numeric argument, \fIx\fR, which specifies the number of users to
display per line. \fIx\fR must be at least \fB1\fR. The \fB-n\fR option can
only be used with \fB-q\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Lists any other process that is currently active and has been previously
spawned by \fBinit\fR. The \fIname\fR field is the name of the program executed
by \fBinit\fR as found in \fB/sbin/inittab\fR. The \fIstate\fR, \fIline\fR, and
\fIidle\fR fields have no meaning. The \fIcomment\fR field shows the \fBid\fR
field of the line from \fB/sbin/inittab\fR that spawned this process. See
\fBinittab\fR(4).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
(Quick \fBwho\fR) Displays only the names and the number of users currently
logged on. When this option is used, all other options are ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Indicates the current \fIrun-level\fR of the \fBinit\fR process.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
(Default) Lists only the \fIname\fR, \fIline\fR, and \fItime\fR fields.
.RE

.SS "/usr/bin/who"
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
Same as the \fB-s\fR option, except that the \fIstate\fR \fIidle\fR, \fIpid\fR,
and \fIcomment\fR, fields are also written. \fIstate\fR is one of the following
characters:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB+\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The terminal allows write access to other users.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB\(mi\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The terminal denies write access to other users.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB?\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The terminal write-access state cannot be determined.
.RE

.RE

.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/who"
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
Same as the \fB-s\fR option, except that the \fIstate\fR field is also written.
\fIstate\fR is one of the characters listed under the \fB/usr/bin/who\fR
version of this option. If the \fB-u\fR option is used with \fB-T\fR, the idle
time is added to the end of the previous format.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
Indicates the last change to the system clock (using the \fBdate\fR utility) by
\fBroot\fR. See \fBsu\fR(1M) and \fBdate\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 7n
Lists only those users who are currently logged in. The \fIname\fR is the
user's login name. The \fIline\fR is the name of the line as found in the
directory \fB/dev\fR. The \fItime\fR is the time that the user logged in. The
\fIidle\fR column contains the number of hours and minutes since activity last
occurred on that particular line. A dot (\fB\&.\fR) indicates that the terminal
has seen activity in the last minute and is therefore ``current.'' If more than
twenty-four hours have elapsed or the line has not been used since boot time,
the entry is marked \fBold\fR. This field is useful when trying to determine
whether a person is working at the terminal or not. The \fIpid\fR is the
process-ID of the user's shell. The \fIcomment\fR is the comment field
associated with this line as found in \fB/sbin/inittab\fR (see
\fBinittab\fR(4)). This can contain information about where the terminal is
located, the telephone number of the dataset, type of terminal if hard-wired,
and so forth.
.RE

.SH NOTES
.LP
\fBSuperuser:\fR After a shutdown to the single-user state, \fBwho\fR returns a
prompt. Since \fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR is updated at login time and there is no
login in single-user state, \fBwho\fR cannot report accurately on this state.
The command, \fBwho\fR \fBam i\fR, however, returns the correct information.
