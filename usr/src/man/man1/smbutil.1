.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBsmbutil\fR command controls the Solaris CIFS client and issues various
commands.
.SS "Subcommands"
.LP
The \fBsmbutil\fR command supports the following subcommands:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBcrypt\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Creates a hash of a password. This subcommand prompts for a password and writes
the hash to standard output. This hash value is suitable for use as a value for
the \fBpassword\fR property in the \fB$HOME/.nsmbrc\fR file.
.sp
The hashed password begins with two dollar signs (\fB$$\fR). If you assign this
hashed password to the \fBpassword\fR property in your \fB$HOME/.nsmbrc\fR, be
sure that you escape the special characters in the password.
.sp
If you plan to store hashed passwords in your \fB$HOME/.nsmbrc\fR file, ensure
that the file permissions are set so that only the owner can read or write the
file (\fB400\fR or \fB600\fR), or the passwords are ignored.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdiscon -U \fIuser\fR]
//[\fIdomain\fR;][\fIuser\fR\fIserver\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disconnects the specified SMB session to \fIserver\fR.
Usage is similar to the \fB\fBview\fR\fR subcommand.
This subcommand is primarily for use in tests.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlogin [-c] [ [[\fIdomain\fR/]\fIuser\fR] | [\fIuser\fR[@\fIdomain\fR]
]\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies persistent password information to be used for a CIFS server user
account. When you specify this information, mounts can be done without a
password prompt in non-Kerberos configurations. Kerberos sites should use
Kerberos automatically, not prompt for a password. If a default domain is
available in SMF or \fBnsmbrc\fR(4), the domain can be omitted. If a user name
is not specified, the Solaris user account name is used.
.sp
Use the \fB-c\fR to check whether a persistent password is set for the
specified user.
.sp
Passwords can also be stored for a specific server by using a server name in
place of the domain name. This capability is useful with servers that are
configured for "workgroup mode."
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlogout [ [[\fIdomain\fR/]\fIuser\fR] | [\fIuser\fR[@\fIdomain\fR] ]\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Erases the persistent passwords for the user running the command.
.sp
The user name and domain name portions of the name are optional. If these names
are not specified, the user name and domain name values are taken from the
properties set in your environment. See the \fBnsmbrc\fR(4) manual page.
.sp
If you stored your password for a specific server, specify the server name in
place of the domain name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlogout -a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Erases all of the persistent passwords that are stored for the user who is
running the command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlogoutall\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Erases all the persistent passwords that are stored by all users running the
\fBsmbutil login\fR command.
.sp
This command must be run as superuser.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlookup \fIname\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Resolves the specified \fIname\fR to an IP address.
.sp
This subcommand is only supported if an NBNS/WINS name server is available.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBstatus \fIserver\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Resolves the specified server to the NetBIOS domain and system name.
\fIserver\fR can be an IP address or a DNS name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBview [-A | -U \fIuser\fR]
//[\fIdomain\fR;][\fIuser\fR[:\fIpassword\fR]@]\fIserver\fR\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Lists the resources available to \fIuser\fR on the specified \fIserver\fR.
.sp
You can specify the \fB-A\fR option to view the resources as an anonymous user
or the \fB-U\fR \fIuser\fR option to view the resources as the specified user.
These options are mutually exclusive.
.sp
If the resource includes a domain, you must escape the semicolon that appears
after the domain name to prevent it from being interpreted by the command
shell. For instance, surround the entire resource name with single quotes:
\fBsmbutil view '//SALES;george@RSERVER'\fR.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS

.SH NOTES
.LP
The Solaris CIFS client always attempts to use \fBgethostbyname()\fR to resolve
host names. If the host name cannot be resolved, the CIFS client uses NetBIOS
name resolution (NBNS). By default, the Solaris CIFS client permits the use of
NBNS to enable Solaris CIFS clients in Windows environments to work without
additional configuration.
.sp
.LP
Since NBNS has been exploited in the past, you might want to disable it. To
disable NBNS, set the \fBnbns-enabled\fR service management facility property
to \fBfalse\fR. By default, \fBnbns-enabled\fR is set to \fBtrue\fR.
