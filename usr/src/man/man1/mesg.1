.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmesg\fR utility will control whether other users are allowed to send
messages via \fBwrite\fR(1), \fBtalk\fR(1), or other utilities to a terminal
device. The terminal device affected is determined by searching for the first
terminal in the sequence of devices associated with standard input, standard
output, and standard error, respectively. With no arguments, \fBmesg\fR reports
the current state without changing it. Processes with appropriate privileges
may be able to send messages to the terminal independent of the current state.
