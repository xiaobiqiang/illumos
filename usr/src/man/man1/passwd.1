.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBpasswd\fR command changes the password or lists password attributes
associated with the user's login \fIname\fR. Additionally, privileged users can
use \fBpasswd\fR to install or change passwords and attributes associated with
any login \fIname\fR.
.sp
.LP
When used to change a password, \fBpasswd\fR prompts everyone for their old
password, if any. It then prompts for the new password twice. When the old
password is entered, \fBpasswd\fR checks to see if it has aged sufficiently. If
\fBaging\fR is insufficient, \fBpasswd\fR terminates; see \fBpwconv\fR(1M)
and \fBshadow\fR(4) for additional information.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpwconv\fR command creates and updates \fB/etc/shadow\fR with information
from \fB/etc/passwd\fR. \fBpwconv\fR relies on a special value of \fBx\fR in
the password field of \fB/etc/passwd\fR. This value of \fBx\fR indicates that
the password for the user is already in \fB/etc/shadow\fR and should not be
modified.
.sp
.LP
If aging is sufficient, a check is made to ensure that the new password meets
construction requirements. When the new password is entered a second time, the
two copies of the new password are compared. If the two copies are not
identical, the cycle of prompting for the new password is repeated for, at
most, two more times.
.sp
.LP
Passwords must be constructed to meet the following requirements:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must have \fBPASSLENGTH\fR characters, where \fBPASSLENGTH\fR is
defined in \fB/etc/default/passwd\fR and is set to \fB6\fR. Setting
\fBPASSLENGTH\fR to more than eight characters requires configuring
\fBpolicy.conf\fR(4) with an algorithm that supports greater than eight
characters.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must meet the configured complexity constraints specified in
\fB/etc/default/passwd\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Each password must not be a member of the configured dictionary as specified in
\fB/etc/default/passwd\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
For accounts in name services which support password history checking, if prior
password history is defined, new passwords must not be contained in the prior
password history.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If all requirements are met, by default, the \fBpasswd\fR command consults
\fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR to determine in which repositories to perform password
update. It searches the \fBpasswd\fR and \fBpasswd_compat\fR entries. The
sources (repositories) associated with these entries are updated. However, the
password update configurations supported are limited to the following cases.
Failure to comply with the configurations prevents users from logging onto the
system. The password update configurations are:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBpasswd: files\fR
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBpasswd: files ldap\fR

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fBpasswd: compat\fR (==> files ldap)
.sp
\fBpasswd_compat: ldap\fR
.RE
.sp
.LP
You can add the \fBad\fR keyword to any of the \fBpasswd\fR configurations in
the above list. However, you cannot use the \fBpasswd\fR command to change the
password of an Active Directory (AD) user. If the \fBad\fR keyword is found in
the \fBpasswd\fR entry during a password update operation, it is ignored. To
update the password of an AD user, use the \fBkpasswd\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
The administrator configured for updating LDAP shadow
information can change any password attributes. See \fBldapclient\fR(1M).
.sp
.LP
When a user has a password stored in one of the name services as well as a
local \fBfiles\fR entry, the \fBpasswd\fR command updates both. It is possible
to have different passwords in the name service and local files entry. Use
\fBpasswd\fR \fB-r\fR to change a specific password repository.
.sp
.LP
In the \fBfiles\fR case, super-users (for instance, real and effective uid
equal to \fB0\fR, see \fBid\fR(1M) and \fBsu\fR(1M)) can change any password.
Hence, \fBpasswd\fR does not prompt privileged users for the old password.
Privileged users are not forced to comply with password aging and password
construction requirements. A privileged user can create a null password by
entering a carriage return in response to the prompt for a new password. (This
differs from \fBpasswd\fR \fB-d\fR because the \fBpassword\fR prompt is still
displayed.) If NIS is in effect, superuser on the root master can change any
password without being prompted for the old NIS \fBpasswd\fR, and is not forced
to comply with password construction requirements.
.sp
.LP
If LDAP is in effect, superuser on any Native LDAP client system can change any
password without being prompted for the old LDAP passwd, and is not forced to
comply with password construction requirements.
.sp
.LP
Normally, \fBpasswd\fR entered with no arguments changes the password of the
current user. When a user logs in and then invokes \fBsu\fR(1M) to become
superuser or another user, \fBpasswd\fR changes the original user's password,
not the password of the superuser or the new user.
.sp
.LP
Any user can use the \fB-s\fR option to show password attributes for his or her
own login \fIname\fR. Otherwise, the \fB-s\fR argument is restricted to the
superuser.

\fBpasswd\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for password change. It calls PAM with a
service name \fBpasswd\fR and uses service module type \fBauth\fR for
authentication and password for password change.
.sp
.LP
Locking an account (\fB-l\fR option) does not allow its use for password based
login or delayed execution (such as \fBat\fR(1), \fBbatch\fR(1), or
\fBcron\fR(1M)). The \fB-N\fR option can be used to disallow password based
login, while continuing to allow delayed execution.

.SH NOTES
.LP
The \fBpam_unix\fR(5) module is no longer supported. Similar functionality is
provided by \fBpam_unix_account\fR(5), \fBpam_unix_auth\fR(5),
\fBpam_unix_session\fR(5), \fBpam_authtok_check\fR(5),
\fBpam_authtok_get\fR(5), \fBpam_authtok_store\fR(5), \fBpam_dhkeys\fR(5), and
\fBpam_passwd_auth\fR(5).

.LP
The \fByppasswd\fR command is a wrapper around \fBpasswd\fR. Use of
\fByppasswd\fR is discouraged. Use \fBpasswd\fR \fB-r\fR \fIrepository_name\fR
instead.

.LP
Changing a password in the \fBfiles\fR and \fBldap\fR repositories clears the
failed login count.
.sp
.LP
Changing a password reactivates an account deactivated for inactivity for the
length of the inactivity period.

.LP
If \fB/etc/shells\fR is present, and is corrupted, it may provide an attack
vector that would compromise the system.  The \fBgetusershell\fR(3c) library
call has a pre-vetted list of shells, so /etc/shells should be used with
caution.
.sp
.LP
Input terminal processing might interpret some key sequences and not pass them
to the \fBpasswd\fR command.
.sp
.LP
An account with no password, status code \fBNP\fR, might not be able to login.
See the \fBlogin\fR(1) \fBPASSREQ\fR option.
