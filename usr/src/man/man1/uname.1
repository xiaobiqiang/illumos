.Sh NAME
.Nm uname
.Nd print name of current system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aimnoprsvX
.Nm
.Fl S Ar system_name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints information about the current system on the standard output.
When options are specified, symbols representing one or more system
characteristics will be written to the standard output.
If no options are specified,
.Nm
prints the current operating system's name.
The options print selected information returned by
.Xr uname 2 ,
.Xr sysinfo 2 ,
or both.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Prints basic information currently available from the system.
.It Fl i
Prints the name of the platform.
.It Fl m
Prints the machine hardware name (class).
Use of this option is discouraged.
Use
.Nm Fl p
instead.
See
.Sx NOTES
section below.
.It Fl n
Prints the nodename (the nodename is the name by which the system is known to a
communications network).
.It Fl o
Prints the name of the kernel/OS.
.It Fl p
Prints the current host's ISA or processor type.
.It Fl r
Prints the operating system release level.
.It Fl s
Prints the name of the operating system.
This is the default.
.It Fl S Ar system_name
The nodename may be changed by specifying a system name argument.
The system name argument is restricted to
.Dv SYS_NMLN
characters.
.Dv SYS_NMLN
is an implementation specific value defined in
.In sys/utsname.h .
Only the super-user is allowed this capability.
This change does not persist across reboots of the system.
See
.Xr nodename 4
for details of how to change a host's name permanently.
.It Fl v
Prints the operating system version.
.It Fl X
Prints expanded system information, one information element per line, as
expected by SCO UNIX.
The displayed information includes:
.Bl -bullet
.It
system name, node, release, version, machine, and number of CPUs.
.It
BusType, Serial, and Users (set to "unknown" in Solaris)
.It
OEM# and Origin# (set to 0 and 1, respectively)

.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy Example 1 No Printing the OS name and release level
The following command:
.Bd -literal
$ uname -sr
.Ed
.Pp
\&...prints the operating system name and release level, separated by one SPACE
character.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
See
.Xr environ 5
for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the
execution of
.Nm :
.Ev LANG , LC_ALL , LC_CTYPE , LC_MESSAGES ,
and
.Ev NLSPATH .
.Sh INTERFACE STABILITY

.Sh NOTES
Independent software vendors (ISVs) and others who need to determine detailed
characteristics of the platform on which their software is either being
installed or executed should use the
.Nm
command.
.Pp
To determine the operating system name and release level, use
.Nm Fl sr .
To determine only the operating system release level, use
.Nm Fl r .
Notice that operating system release levels are not guaranteed to be in
.Em x.y
format (such as 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and so forth); but could be in the
.Em x.y.z
format (such as 5.5.1).
.Pp
In SunOS 4.x releases, the
.Xr arch 1
command was often used to obtain information similar to that obtained by using
the
.Nm
command.
The
.Xr arch 1
command output
.Ql sun4
was often incorrectly interpreted to signify a SunOS SPARC system.
If hardware platform information is desired, use
.Nm Fl sp .
.Pp
The
.Nm arch Fl k
and
.Nm Fl m
commands return equivalent values; however, the use of either of these commands
by third party programs is discouraged, as is the use of the
.Nm arch
command in general.
To determine the machine's Instruction Set Architecture (ISA or processor type),
use
.Nm
with the
.Fl p
option.
