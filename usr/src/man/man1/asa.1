.TH ASA 1 "Apr 18, 1995"
.SH NAME
asa \- convert FORTRAN carriage-control output to printable form
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBasa\fR [\fB-f\fR] [\fIfile\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBasa\fR utility will write its input files to standard output, mapping
carriage-control characters from the text files to line-printer control
sequences.
.sp
.LP
The first character of every line will be removed from the input, and the
following actions will be performed.
.sp
.LP
If the character removed is:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBSPACE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
The rest of the line will be output without change.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
It is replaced by a newline control sequence followed by the rest  of the input
line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
It is replaced by a newpage control sequence followed by the rest  of the input
line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB+\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
It is replaced by a control sequence that causes printing to  return to the
first column of the previous line, where the rest of  the input line is
printed.
.RE

.sp
.LP
For any other character in the first column of an input line, \fBasa\fR skips
the character and prints the rest of the line unchanged.
.sp
.LP
If \fBasa\fR is called without providing a \fIfilename\fR, the standard input
is used.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following option is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Start each file on a new page.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
A pathname of a text file used for input. If no \fBfile\fR operands are
specified, or `\fB\|\(mi\|\fR\&' is specified, then the standard input will be
used.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.LP
The command
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBa.out | asa | lp\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
converts output from \fBa.out\fR to conform with conventional printers and
directs it through a pipe to the printer.
.sp
.LP
The command
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBasa \fI output\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
shows the contents of file \fIoutput\fR on a terminal as it would appear on a
printer.
.sp
.LP
The following program is used in the next two examples:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
write(*,'(" Blank")')
write(*,'("0Zero ")')
write(*,'("+        Plus ")')
write(*,'("1One  ")')
end
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Both of the following examples produce two pages of output:
.sp
.LP
Page 1:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
Blank

ZeroPlus
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Page 2:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
One
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing actual files
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBa.out >  MyOutputFile
asa < MyOutputFile | lp\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRUsing only pipes
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBa.out |  asa | lp\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP

that affect the execution of \fBasa\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
All input files were output successfully.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
An error occurred.
.RE
