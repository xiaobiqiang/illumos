.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
A \fIrecipient\fR is usually a domain style address
("\fIuser\fR@\fImachine\fR") or a user name recognized by \fBlogin\fR(1). When
\fIrecipient\fRs are named, \fBmail\fR assumes a message is being sent. It
reads from the standard input up to an end-of-file (Control-d) or, if reading
from a terminal device, until it reads a line consisting of just a period. When
either of those indicators is received, \fBmail\fR adds the \fIletter\fR to the
\fImailfile\fR for each \fIrecipient\fR.
.sp
.LP
A \fIletter\fR is composed of some \fIheader lines\fR followed by a blank line
followed by the \fImessage content\fR. The \fIheader lines\fR section of the
letter consists of one or more UNIX postmarks:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBFrom\fR \fIsender date_and_time\fR [\fBremote from\fR \fIremote_system_name\fR]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
followed by one or more standardized message header lines of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIkeyword-name\fR\fB:\fR [\fIprintable text\fR]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
where \fIkeyword-name\fR is comprised of any printable, non-whitespace
characters other than colon (`\fB:\fR'). A \fBMIME-version:\fR header line
indicates that the message is formatted as described in RFC 2045. A
\fBContent-Length:\fR header line, indicating the number of bytes in the
\fImessage content\fR, is always present unless the letter consists of only
header lines with no message content. A \fBContent-Type:\fR header line that
describes the type of the \fImessage content\fR (such as text/plain,
application/octet-stream, and so on) is also present, unless the letter
consists of only header lines with no message content. Header lines may be
continued on the following line if that line starts with white space.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Sending Mail"
.sp
.LP
The following command-line arguments affect sending mail:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImessage_type\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
A \fBMessage-Type:\fR line is added to the message header with the value of
\fImessage_type\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
A \fBTo:\fR line is added to the message header for each of the intended
\fIrecipient\fRs.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
A letter is sent to a remote recipient without waiting for the completion of
the remote transfer program.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If a letter is found to be undeliverable, it is returned to the sender with
diagnostics that indicate the location and nature of the failure. If \fBmail\fR
is interrupted during input, the message is saved in the file \fBdead.letter\fR
to allow editing and resending. \fBdead.letter\fR is always appended to, thus
preserving any previous contents. The initial attempt to append to (or create)
\fBdead.letter\fR is in the current directory. If this fails, \fBdead.letter\fR
is appended to (or created in) the user's login directory. If the second
attempt also fails, no \fBdead.letter\fR processing is done.
.sp
.LP
\fBrmail\fR only permits the sending of mail; \fBuucp\fR(1C) uses \fBrmail\fR
as a security precaution. Any application programs that generate mail messages
should be sure to invoke \fBrmail\fR rather than \fBmail\fR for message
transport and/or delivery.
.sp
.LP
If the local system has the Basic Networking Utilities installed, mail can be
sent to a recipient on a remote system. There are numerous ways to address mail
to recipients on remote systems depending on the transport mechanisms available
to the local system. The two most prevalent addressing schemes are Domain-style
and UUCP-style.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBDomain-style addressing\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
Remote recipients are specified by appending an `\fB@\fR' and domain (and
possibly sub-domain) information to the recipient name (such as
\fBuser@sf.att.com\fR). (The local system administrator should be consulted for
details on which addressing conventions are available on the local system.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBUUCP-style addressing\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
Remote recipients are specified by prefixing the recipient name with the remote
system name and an exclamation point, such as \fBsysa!user.\fR If \fBcsh\fR(1)
is the default shell, \fBsysa\e!user\fR should be used. A series of system
names separated by exclamation points can be used to direct a letter through an
extended network (such as \fBsysa!sysb!sysc!user\fR or
\fBsysa\e!sysb\e!sysc\e!user\fR).
.RE

.SS "Reading Mail"
.sp
.LP
The following command-line arguments affect reading mail:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Test for the presence of mail. \fBmail\fR prints nothing.
.sp
An exit status of \fB0\fR is returned if the user has mail. Otherwise, an exit
status of \fB1\fR is returned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-E\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Similar to \fB-e\fR, but tests only for the presence of \fBnew\fR mail.
.sp
An  exit  status  of \fB0\fR is returned if the user has new            mail
to read,  an exit status of \fB1\fR is returned if the            user  has no
mail,  or an exit status of \fB2\fR is returned            if the user has mail
which has already been read.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
A window of headers are initially displayed rather than the latest message. The
display is followed by the \fB?\fR prompt.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
All messages are printed without prompting for disposition.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n

default selective header line display.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
\fBmail\fR terminates after interrupts. Normally an interrupt causes only the
termination of the message being printed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RS 11n
Messages are printed in first-in, first-out order.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-f\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
\fBmail\fR uses \fIfile\fR (such as \fBmbox\fR) instead of the default
\fImailfile\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fBmail\fR, unless otherwise influenced by command-line arguments, prints a
user's mail messages in last-in, first-out order. The default mode for printing
messages is to display only those header lines of immediate interest. These
include, but are not limited to, the UNIX \fBFrom\fR and \fB>From\fR postmarks,
\fBFrom:\fR, \fBDate:\fR, \fBSubject:\fR, and \fBContent-Length:\fR header
lines, and any recipient header lines such as \fBTo:\fR, \fBCc:\fR, \fBBcc:\fR,
and so forth. After the header lines have been displayed, \fBmail\fR displays
the contents (body) of the message only if it contains no unprintable
characters. Otherwise, \fBmail\fR issues a warning statement about the message
having binary content and \fBnot\fR display the content. This can be overridden
by means of the \fBp\fR command.
.sp
.LP
For each message, the user is prompted with a \fB?\fR and a line is read from
the standard input. The following commands are available to determine the
disposition of the message:
.sp

.RE

.sp
.LP
When a user logs in, the presence of mail, if any, is usually indicated. Also,
notification is made if new mail arrives while using \fBmail\fR.
.sp
.LP
The permissions of \fImailfile\fR can be manipulated using \fBchmod\fR(1) in
two ways to alter the function of \fBmail\fR. The other permissions of the file
can be read-write (\fB0666\fR), read-only (\fB0664\fR), or neither read nor
write (\fB0660\fR) to allow different levels of privacy. If changed to other
than the default (mode \fB0660\fR), the file is preserved even when empty to
perpetuate the desired permissions. (The administrator can override this file
preservation using the \fBDEL_EMPTY_MAILFILE\fR option of \fBmailcnfg\fR.)
.sp
.LP
The group \fBID\fR of the mailfile must be \fBmail\fR to allow new messages to
be delivered, and the mailfile must be writable by group \fBmail\fR.
.SS "Debugging"
.sp
.LP
The following command-line arguments cause \fBmail\fR to provide debugging
information:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR \fIdebug_level\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
\fBmail\fR creates a trace file containing debugging information.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fB-x\fR option causes \fBmail\fR to create a file named
\fB/tmp/MLDBG\fR\fIprocess_id\fR that contains debugging information relating
to how \fBmail\fR processed the current message. The absolute value of
\fIdebug_level\fR controls the verboseness of the debug information. \fB0\fR
implies no debugging. If \fIdebug_level\fR is greater than \fB0\fR, the debug
file is retained \fIonly\fR if \fBmail\fR encountered some problem while
processing the message. If \fIdebug_level\fR is less than \fB0\fR, the debug
file is always be retained. The \fIdebug_level\fR specified via \fB-x\fR
overrides any specification of \fBDEBUG\fR in \fB/etc/mail/mailcnfg\fR. The
information provided by the \fB-x\fR option is esoteric and is probably only
useful to system administrators.
.SS "Delivery Notification"

Several forms of notification are available for mail by including one of the
following lines in the message header.

The interpretation and resulting action taken because of the header lines
described in the Delivery Notifications section only occur if this version of
\fBmail\fR is installed on the system where the delivery (or failure) happens.
Earlier versions of \fBmail\fR might not support any types of delivery
notification.
