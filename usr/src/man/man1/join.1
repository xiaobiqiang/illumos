     [\fB-j2\fR \fIfieldnumber\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIlist\fR] [\fB-e\fR \fIstring\fR] [\fB-t\fR \fIchar\fR] \fIfile1\fR \fIfile2\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBjoin\fR command forms, on the standard output, a join of the two
relations specified by the lines of \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR.
.sp
.LP
There is one line in the output for each pair of lines in \fIfile1\fR and
\fIfile2\fR that have identical join fields. The output line normally consists
of the common field, then the rest of the line from \fIfile1\fR, then the rest
of the line from \fIfile2\fR. This format can be changed by using the \fB-o\fR
option (see below). The \fB-a\fR option can be used to add unmatched lines to
the output. The \fB-v\fR option can be used to output only unmatched lines.
.sp
.LP
The default input field separators are blank, tab, or new-line. In this case,
multiple separators count as one field separator, and leading separators are
ignored. The default output field separator is a blank.
.sp
.LP
If the input files are not in the appropriate collating sequence, the results
are unspecified.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
Some of the options below use the argument \fIfilenumber\fR. This argument
should be a \fB1\fR or a \fB2\fR referring to either \fIfile1\fR or
\fIfile2\fR, respectively.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIfilenumber\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 20n
In addition to the normal output, produce a line for each unpairable line in
file \fIfilenumber\fR, where \fIfilenumber\fR is \fB1\fR or \fB2\fR. If both
\fB-a\fR \fB1\fR and \fB-a\fR \fB2\fR are specified, all unpairable lines will
be output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fIstring\fR \fR

Replace empty output fields in the list selected by option \fB-o\fR with the
string \fIstring\fR.

\fB1\fR.
.RE

.sp

.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIlist\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 20n
Each output line includes the fields specified in \fIlist\fR. Fields selected
by \fIlist\fR that do not appear in the input will be treated as empty output
fields. (See the \fB-e\fR option.) Each element of which has the either the
form \fIfilenumber\fR\fB\&.\fR\fIfieldnumber\fR\fB,\fR or \fB0\fR, which
represents the \fBjoin\fR field. The common field is not printed unless
specifically requested.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fIchar\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 20n
Use character \fIchar\fR as a separator. Every appearance of \fIchar\fR in a
line is significant. The character \fIchar\fR is used as the field separator
for both input and output. With this option specified, the collating term
should be the same as \fBsort\fR without the \fB-b\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR \fIfilenumber\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 20n
Instead of the default output, produce a line only for each unpairable line in
\fIfilenumber\fR, where \fIfilenumber\fR is \fB1\fR or \fB2\fR. If both
\fB-v\fR \fB1\fR and \fB-v\fR \fB2\fR are specified, all unpairable lines will
be output.

.SH OPERANDS

.RS 10n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fIfile2\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
A path name of a file to be joined. If either of the \fIfile1\fR or \fIfile2\fR
operands is \fB\(mi\fR, the standard input is used in its place.
.RE

.sp
.LP
\fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR must be sorted in increasing collating sequence as
determined by \fBLC_COLLATE\fR on the fields on which they are to be joined,
normally the first in each line (see \fBsort\fR(1)).
.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBjoin\fR when
encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (2^31 bytes).
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRJoining the password file and group file
.sp
.LP
The following command line will join the password file and the group file,
matching on the numeric group ID, and outputting the login name, the group name
and the login directory. It is assumed that the files have been sorted in
\fBASCII\fR collating sequence on the group ID fields.

\fBExample 2 \fRUsing the -o option

.LP
The \fB-o\fR \fB0\fR field essentially selects the union of the join fields.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBjoin\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
With default field separation, the collating sequence is that of \fBsort\fR
\fB-\fR\fBb\fR; with \fB-t\fR, the sequence is that of a plain sort.
.sp
.LP
The conventions of the \fBjoin\fR, \fBsort\fR, \fBcomm\fR, \fBuniq\fR, and
\fBawk\fR commands are wildly incongruous.
