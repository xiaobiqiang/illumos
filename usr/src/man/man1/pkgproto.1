.SH NAME
pkgproto \- generate prototype file entries for input to pkgmk command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpkgproto\fR [\fB-i\fR] [\fB-c\fR \fIclass\fR] [\fIpath1\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBpkgproto\fR [\fB-i\fR] [\fB-c\fR \fIclass\fR] [\fIpath1=path2\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgproto\fR scans the indicated paths and generates \fBprototype\fR(4) file
entries that may be used as input to the \fBpkgmk\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
If no paths are specified on the command line, standard input is assumed to be
a list of paths. If the pathname listed on the command line is a directory,
the contents of the directory is searched. However, if input is read from
\fBstdin\fR, a directory specified as a pathname will not be searched.
.sp
.LP
Package commands, such as \fBpkgproto\fR, are \fBlargefile\fR(5)-aware. They
handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In
their current implementations, \fBpkgadd\fR(1M), \fBpkgtrans\fR(1) and other
package commands can process a datastream of  up to 4 GB.
.SH OPTIONS

Ignores symbolic links and records the paths as \fBftype\fR=\fBf\fR (a file)
versus \fBftype\fR=\fBs\fR (symbolic link).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBpkgproto\fR creates symbolic link entries for any symbolic link
encountered (\fBftype\fR=\fBs\fR). When you use the \fB-i\fR option,
\fBpkgproto\fR creates a file entry for symbolic links (\fBftype\fR=\fBf\fR).
The \fBprototype\fR(4) file would have to be edited to assign such file types
as \fBv\fR (volatile), \fBe\fR (editable), or \fBx\fR (exclusive directory).
\fBpkgproto\fR detects linked files. If multiple files are linked together, the
first path encountered is considered the source of the link.
.sp
.LP
By default, \fBpkgproto\fR prints prototype entries on the standard output.
However, the output should be saved in a file (named \fBPrototype\fR or
\fBprototype\fR, for convenience) to be used as input to the \fBpkgmk\fR(1)
command.
