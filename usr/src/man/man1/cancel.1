.SH NAME
cancel \- cancel print request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcancel\fR [\fIrequest-ID\fR...] [\fIdestination\fR]...
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBcancel\fR \fB-u\fR \fIuser\fR... [\fIdestination\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBcancel\fR utility cancels print requests. There are two forms of the
\fBcancel\fR command.
.sp
.LP
The first form of \fBcancel\fR has two optional arguments: print requests
(\fIrequest-ID\fR) and destinations (\fIdestination\fR). Specifying
\fIrequest-ID\fR with \fIdestination\fR cancels \fIrequest-ID\fR on
\fIdestination\fR. Specifying only the destination cancels the current print
request on \fIdestination\fR. If \fIdestination\fR is not specified,
\fBcancel\fR cancels the requested print request on all destinations.
.sp
.LP
The second form of \fBcancel\fR cancels a user's print requests on specific
destinations.
.sp
.LP
Users can only cancel print requests associated with their username. By
default, users can only cancel print requests on the host from which the print
request was submitted. If a super-user has set \fBuser-equivalence=true\fR in
\fB/etc/printers.conf\fR on the print server, users can cancel print requests
associated with their username on any host. Super-users can cancel print
requests on the host from which the print request was submitted. Superusers can
also cancel print requests from the print server.
.sp
.LP
The print client commands locate destination information using the
\fBprinters\fR database in the name service switch. See \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4),
\fBprinters\fR(4), and \fBprinters.conf\fR(4) for details.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fIuser\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
The name of the user for which print requests are to be cancelled. Specify
\fIuser\fR as a username.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIdestination\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
The destination on which the print requests are to be canceled.
\fIdestination\fR is the name of a printer or class of printers (see
\fBlpadmin\fR(1M)). If \fIdestination\fR is not specified, \fBcancel\fR cancels
the requested print request on all destinations. Specify \fIdestination\fR
using atomic, URI-style (\fIscheme\fR\fB://\fR\fIendpoint\fR), or POSIX-style
(\fIserver\fR\fB:\fR\fIdestination\fR), names. See Notes for information
regarding using URI-style or POSIX-style destination names with \fBcancel\fR.
See \fBprinters.conf\fR(4) for more information.

.SH NOTES
.LP
URI-style and POSIX-style destination names (\fIserver\fR:\fIdestination\fR)
are treated as print requests if \fIdestination\fR has the same format as an
\fBLP-style\fR \fIrequest-ID\fR. See \fBstandards\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
Some print servers send cancellation notifications to job owners when their
print jobs have been cancelled. This notification usually comes in the form of
an email message. Cancellation notices cannot be disabled on a Solaris server.
.sp
.LP
When IPP is in use, the user is prompted for a passphrase if the remote print
service is configured to require authentication.
