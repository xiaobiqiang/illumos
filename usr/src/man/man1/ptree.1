.SH NAME
ptree \- print process trees
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/ptree\fR [\fB-a\fR] [\fB-c\fR] [\fB-z\fR \fIzone\fR] [\fIpid\fR | \fIuser\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBptree\fR utility prints the process trees containing the specified
\fIpid\fRs or \fIuser\fRs, with child processes indented from their respective
parent processes. An argument of all digits is taken to be a process-ID,
otherwise it is assumed to be a user login name. The default is all processes.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
All. Print all processes, including children of process 0.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Contracts. Print process contract memberships in addition to parent-child
relationships. See \fBprocess\fR(4). This option implies the \fB-a\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR \fIzone\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Zones. Print only processes in the specified \fIzone\fR. Each zone \fBID\fR can
be specified as either a zone name or a numerical zone \fBID\fR.
.sp
This option is only useful when executed in the global zone.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIpid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
Process-id or a list of process-ids. \fBptree\fR also accepts
\fB/proc/\fR\fInnn\fR as a process-id, so the shell expansion \fB/proc/*\fR can
be used to specify all processes in the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIuser\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
Username or list of usernames. Processes whose effective user IDs match those
given are displayed.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing ptree
.sp
.LP
The following example prints the process tree (including children of process 0)
for processes which match the command name \fBssh\fR:

.sp
