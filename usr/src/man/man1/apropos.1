.Sh NAME
.Nm apropos, whatis
.Nd locate commands by keyword lookup
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm apropos
.Op Fl M Ar path
.Op Fl s Ar section
.Ar keyword ...
.Nm whatis
.Op Fl M Ar path
.Op Fl s Ar section
.Ar keyword ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm apropos
utility displays the man page name, section number, and a
short description for each man page whose
.Em NAME
line contains
.Ar keyword .
This information is contained in the
.Nm whatis
database created by the
.Fl w
option used with
.Xr man 1 .
If this database is not present,
.Nm apropos
and
.Nm whatis
fail.
.Lp
Each word is considered
separately and the case of letters is ignored.
Words which are part of other words are considered; for example, when looking
for
.Sq compile ,
.Nm apropos
finds all instances of
.Sq compiler
also.
.Lp
The
.Nm whatis
command performs the same search, but only matches whole words.
In the above example,
.Nm whatis
would not match the instances of
.Sq compiler
when
.Ar keyword
is
.Sq compile .
.Lp
The
.Nm apropos
command is actually just the
.Fl k
option to the
.Xr man 1
command.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-s section"
.It Fl M Ar path
Force a specific colon separated manual path instead of the
default search path.
Overrides the MANPATH environment variable.
.It Fl s Ar section
Restrict search to specified section.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Example 1 To find a man page whose NAME line contains a keyword
