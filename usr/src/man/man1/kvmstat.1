.Sh NAME
.Nm kvmstat
.Nd report KVM statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kvmstat
.Oo
.Ar interval
.Op Ar count
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reports the activity of running KVM virtual machines and their exit activity,
injected interrupts, emulations, and more, on a per virtual CPU basis.
.Lp
.Nm
should be used when trying to get a rough sense of guest activity from the
hypervisor's perspective, and allows one to understand from a low-level
perspective, what kind of activity is going on inside of the virtual machine.
In addition,
.Nm
is useful for diagnosing reports of pathological or faulty behavior inside of
guests.
While there is no expected range of values for the fields displayed as that
varies with the use of virtual machines, if all of the virtual CPUs for a given
virtual machine are consistently zero, then that may indicate that a problem has
occurred, for example, a panic inside of the guest or a bug in the hypervisor.
.Lp
If no operands are specified, then
.Nm
will display statistics every second until the program is terminated.
.Ss Output Fields
Every
.Ar interval
.Nm
will report data with the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Nm pid
Identifier of the process controlling the virtual CPU.
.It Nm vcpu
Virtual CPU identifier relative to its virtual machine.
.It Nm exits
Count of all virtual machine exits for the virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm haltx
Count of virtual machine exits due to the guest executing the
.Sy HLT
instruction for the virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm irqx
Count of virtual machine exits due to a pending external interrupt arriving
on the physical CPU that the virtual CPU was actively running on over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm irqwx
Count of virtual machine exits due to an open interrupt window on the
virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm iox
Count of virtual machine exits due to the execution of an I/O instruction,
such as
.Sy inb ,
on the virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm mmiox
Count of virtual machine exits due to performing memory mapped I/O on the
virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm irqs
Count of interrupts injected into the virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm emul
Count of instructions the hypervisor had to emulate on behalf of the guest
virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.It Nm eptv
Count of extended page table violations serviced on the virtual CPU over
.Ar interval .
.El
