.SH NAME
pwd \- return working directory name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/pwd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpwd\fR utility writes an absolute path name of the current working
directory to standard output.
.sp
.LP
Both the Bourne shell, \fBsh\fR(1), and the Korn shells, \fBksh\fR(1) and
\fBksh93\fR(1), also have a built-in \fBpwd\fR command.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBpwd\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Successful completion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
An error occurred.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If an error is detected, output will not be written to standard output, a
diagnostic message will be written to standard error, and the exit status will
not be  \fB0\fR.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.sp
.LP
See \fBattributes\fR(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

\fBstandards\fR(5)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.LP
``\fBCannot open ..\fR'' and ``\fBRead error in ..\fR'' indicate possible file
system trouble and should be referred to a UNIX system administrator.
.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
If you move the current directory or one above it,  \fBpwd\fR may not give the
correct response. Use the  \fBcd\fR(1) command with a full path name to correct
this situation.
