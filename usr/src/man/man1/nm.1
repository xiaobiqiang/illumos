.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnm\fR utility displays the symbol table of each \fBELF\fR object file
that is specified by \fIfile\fR.
.sp
.LP
If no symbolic information is available for a valid input file, the \fBnm\fR
utility reports that fact, but not consider it an error condition.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The output of \fBnm\fR can be controlled using the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Writes the full path name or library name of an object on each line.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Demangles C++ symbol names before printing them out.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Displays the \fBSHT_DYNSYM\fR symbol information. This is the symbol table used
by \fBld.so.1\fR and is present even in stripped dynamic executables. If
\fB-D\fR is not specified, the default behavior is to display the
\fBSHT_SYMTAB\fR symbol information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
See NOTES below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-L\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Displays the \fBSHT_SUNW_LDYNSYM\fR symbol information. This symbol table
contains local function symbols. \fBSHT_SUNW_LDYNSM\fR symbol tables are
present even in stripped dynamic executables. These symbols augment the global
symbols that are found in \fBSHT_DYNSYM\fR symbol table. If \fB-L\fR is not
specified, the default behavior is to display the \fBSHT_SYMTAB\fR symbol
information.
