.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlp\fR utility submits print requests to a destination. There are two
formats of the \fBlp\fR command.
.sp
.LP
The first form of \fBlp\fR prints files (\fIfile\fR) and associated information
(collectively called a \fIprint request\fR). If \fIfile\fR is not specified,
\fBlp\fR assumes the standard input. Use a hyphen (\fB\(mi\fR) with \fIfile\fR
to specify the standard input. Files are printed in the order in which they
appear on the command line.
.sp
.LP
The second form of \fBlp\fR changes print request options. This form of
\fBlp\fR can only be used with print services and protocols that support job
modification. The LP print service allows print requests to be modified when
they are in a queue local to the system that the lp commands was executed on.
The Internet Print Protocol (IPP) allows job modification on remote ipp print
services.
.sp
.LP
The print request identified by \fIrequest-ID\fR is changed according to the
printing options specified. The printing options available are the same as
those with the first form of the \fBlp\fR. If the request has finished printing
when the \fBlp\fR command is executed, the change is rejected. If the request
is in the process of printing, it is stopped and restarted from the beginning
(unless the \fB-P\fR option has been given).
.sp
.LP
The print client commands locate destination information using the "printers"
database in the name service switch. See \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4),
\fBprinters\fR(4), and \fBprinters.conf\fR(4) for details.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
Printers that have a 4.\fIx\fR or \fBBSD-based print server\fR are not
configured to handle \fBBSD\fR protocol extensions. \fBlp\fR handles print
requests sent to such destinations differently (see NOTES).
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Copies \fIfile\fR before printing.
.sp
Unless \fB-c\fR is specified, users should not remove any \fIfile\fR before the
print request has completely printed. Changes made to \fIfile\fR after the
print request is made but before it is printed might be reflected in the
printed output. \fIfile\fR is linked (as opposed to copied).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdestination\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Prints \fIfile\fR on a specific destination. The \fB-d\fR option is used to set
the destination only when the job is first created. (\fBNote:\fR To move
existing jobs to a different destination, see \fBlpmove\fR(1M).)
\fIdestination\fR can be either a printer or a class of printers (see
\fBlpadmin\fR(1M)). Specify \fIdestination\fR using atomic, URI-style
(\fIscheme\fR://\fIendpoint\fR), or POSIX-style
(\fIserver\fR\fB:\fR\fIdestination\fR) names. See \fBprinters.conf\fR(4) for
more information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIform-name\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Prints \fIfile\fR on \fIform-name\fR. The \fBLP\fR print service ensures that
the form is mounted on the printer. The print request is rejected if the
printer does not support \fIform-name\fR, if \fIform-name\fR is not defined for
the system, or if the user is not allowed to use \fIform-name\fR (see
\fBlpforms\fR(1M)).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-H\fR \fIspecial-handling\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Prints the print request according to the value of \fIspecial-handling\fR. The
following \fIspecial-handling\fR values are acceptable:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBhold\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Do not print the print request until notified. If printing has already begun,
stop it. Other print requests are placed ahead of a request that has been put
on hold (\fIheld print request\fR) until the print request is resumed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBresume\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Resume a held print request. If the print request had begun to print when held,
it is the next print request printed, unless it is superseded by an
\fIimmediate\fR print request.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBimmediate\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Print the print request next. If more than one print request is assigned, the
most recent print request is printed next. If a print request is currently
printing on the desired printer, a \fBhold\fR request must be issued to allow
the immediate request to print. The \fBimmediate\fR request is only available
to \fBLP\fR administrators.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIrequest-ID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Changes options for the print request identified by \fIrequest-ID\fR. There
must be a space between \fB-i\fR and \fIrequest-ID\fR.
.sp
This option applies to jobs that are in a local queue on a print server. This
also applies to remote queues on when the remote print server supports IPP with
job modification.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Sends mail after \fIfile\fR has printed (see \fBmail\fR(1)). By default, no
mail is sent upon normal completion of a print request.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fInumber\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Prints a specific number of copies of \fIfile\fR. Specify \fInumber\fR as a
digit. The default for \fInumber\fR is \fB1\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIoption\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Specifies printer-dependent \fIoptions\fR. Specify several options by
specifying \fB-o\fR \fIoption\fR multiple times (\fB-o\fR \fIoption\fR \fB-o\fR
\fIoption\fR \fB-o\fR \fIoption\fR ). Printer-dependent options can also be
specified using the \fB-o\fR keyletter once, followed by a list of options
enclosed in double quotes (\fB-o\fR"\fIoption\fR \fIoption option\fR").
.sp
\fIoption\fRs take the following forms:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIkey\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Associates information with the request for use by the backend print service.
The keys and values that can be used are specific to the backend print service
and queue configuration.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB[no]key\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n

\fB\fBnobanner\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Does not print a banner page with the request. This option can be disallowed by

Prints the print request with pages of a specific length in inches,
centimeters, or number of lines. Append the letter \fBi\fR for inches or
\fBc\fR for centimeters to \fInumber\fR. Indicate the number of lines by
specifying \fInumber\fR alone. \fBlength=66\fR indicates a page length of
\fB66\fR lines. \fBlength=11i\fR indicates a page length of \fB11\fR inches.

centimeters to \fInumber\fR. Indicate the number of columns by specifying
\fInumber\fR alone. \fBwidth=65\fR indicates a page width of \fB65\fR columns.
\fBwidth=6.5i\fR indicates a page width of \fB6.5\fR inches. \fBwidth=10c\fR

\fB\fBcpi=\fR\fIn\fR|\fBpica\fR|\fBelite\fR|\fBcompressed\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Prints the print request with the character pitch set to \fInumber\fR
characters in an inch. Use \fInumber\fR to specify the number of characters in
an inch. Use \fBpica\fR to set character pitch to pica (\fB10\fR characters per
inch), or \fBelite\fR to set character pitch to elite (\fB12\fR characters per
inch) Use \fBcompressed\fR to set character pitch to as many characters as the
printer can handle. There is no standard number of characters per inch for all
printers; see the \fBterminfo\fR database (see \fBterminfo\fR(4)) for the
default character pitch for your printer. This option can not be used with the

Prints the pages specified in \fIpage-list\fR in ascending order. Specify
\fIpage-list\fR as a of range of numbers, single page number, or a combination

The \fB-P\fR option can only be used if there is a filter available to handle
it; otherwise, the print request is rejected.

.RS 23n
Assigns the print request a priority in the print queue. Specify
\fIpriority-level\fR as an integer between from \fB0\fR and \fB39\fR. Use
\fB0\fR to indicate the highest priority; \fB39\fR to indicate the lowest
priority. If no priority is specified, the default priority for a print service
is assigned by the \fBLP\fR administrator. The \fBLP\fR administrator can also
assign a default priority to individual users.

one specified with the \fB-S\fR option, the request is rejected. Printers using
mountable print wheels or font cartridges use the print wheel or font cartridge
mounted at the time of the print request, unless the \fB-S\fR option is
specified.
