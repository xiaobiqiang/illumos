.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBps\fR command prints information about active processes. Without
options, \fBps\fR prints information about processes that have the same
effective user \fBID\fR and the same controlling terminal as the invoker. The
output contains only the process \fBID\fR, terminal identifier, cumulative
execution time, and the command name. Otherwise, the information that is
displayed is controlled by the options.
.sp
.LP
Some options accept lists as arguments. Items in a list can be either separated
by commas or else enclosed in quotes and separated by commas or spaces. Values
for \fIproclist\fR and \fIgrplist\fR must be numeric.

\fB\fB-u\fR \fIuidlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Lists only process data whose effective user \fBID\fR number or login name is
given in \fIuidlist\fR. In the listing, the numerical user \fBID\fR is printed
unless you give the \fB-f\fR option, which prints the login name.
.sp
This option is ignored when the \fB-e\fR option is also specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-U\fR \fIuidlist\fR\fR
.ad

\fB\fB-y\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Under a long listing (\fB-l\fR), omits the obsolete \fBF\fR and \fBADDR\fR
columns and includes an \fBRSS\fR column to report the resident set size of the
process. Under the \fB-y\fR option, both \fBRSS\fR and \fBSZ\fR (see below) is
reported in units of kilobytes instead of pages.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR \fIzonelist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Lists only processes in the specified zones. Zones can be specified either by

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-Z\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Prints the name of the zone with which the process is associated under an
additional column header, \fBZONE\fR. The \fBZONE\fR column width is limited to
8 characters. Use \fBps\fR \fB-eZ\fR for a quick way to see information about
every process now running along with the associated zone name. Use
.sp
.in +2
.nf
ps -eo zone,uid,pid,ppid,time,comm,...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

to see zone names wider than 8 characters.
.RE

.sp
.LP
Many of the options shown are used to select processes to list. If any are
specified, the default list is ignored and \fBps\fR selects the processes
represented by the inclusive OR of all the selection-criteria options.
.SH DISPLAY FORMATS
.LP
Under the \fB-f\fR option, \fBps\fR tries to determine the command name and
arguments given when the process was created by examining the user block.
Failing this, the command name is printed, as it would have appeared without
the \fB-f\fR option, in square brackets.
.sp
.LP
The column headings and the meaning of the columns in a \fBps\fR listing are
given below; the letters \fBf\fR and \fBl\fR indicate the option (f\fBull\fR or
\fBl\fRong, respectively) that causes the corresponding heading to appear;
\fBall\fR means that the heading always appears. \fBNote:\fR These two options
determine only what information is provided for a process; they do not
determine which processes are listed.
.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBF\fR(l)\fR

The format specification must be a list of names presented as a single
argument, blank- or comma-separated. Each variable has a default header. The
default header can be overridden by appending an equals sign and the new text
of the header. The rest of the characters in the argument is used as the header
text. The fields specified are written in the order specified on the command
line, and should be arranged in columns in the output. The field widths are
selected by the system to be at least as wide as the header text (default or
overridden value). If the header text is null, such as \fB-o\fR \fIuser=,\fR
the field width is at least as wide as the default header text.
Long names are not truncated in this mode.
If all header text fields are null, no header line is written.

.SH NOTES
.LP
Things can change while \fBps\fR is running. The snapshot it gives is true only
for a split-second, and it might not be accurate by the time you see it. Some
data printed for defunct processes is irrelevant.
.sp
.LP
If no options to select processes are specified, \fBps\fR reports all processes
associated with the controlling terminal. If there is no controlling terminal,
there is no report other than the header.
.sp
.LP
\fBps\fR \fB-ef\fR or \fBps\fR \fB-o\fR \fBstime\fR might not report the actual
start of a tty login session, but rather an earlier time, when a getty was last
respawned on the tty line.
.sp
.LP
\fBps\fR is \fBCSI\fR-enabled except for login names (usernames).
