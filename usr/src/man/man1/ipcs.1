.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBipcs\fR utility prints information about active inter-process
communication facilities. The information that is displayed is controlled by
the options supplied. Without options, information is printed in short format
for message queues, shared memory, and semaphores that are currently active in
the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp

all three is printed subject to these options:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR

\fImtype\fR found on any message queue that the user invoking \fBipcs\fR has
permission to read. If \fImtype\fR is \fB0\fR, all messages are displayed. If
\fImtype\fR is negative, all messages with type less than or equal to the
absolute value of \fImtype\fR are displayed. (See \fBmsgrcv\fR(2) and

zone.
.RE

The column headings and the meaning of the columns in an \fBipcs\fR listing are
given below. The letters in parentheses indicate the options that cause the
corresponding heading to appear and "all" means that the heading always
appears. \fBNote:\fR These options only determine what information is provided
for each facility; they do not determine which facilities are listed.

The facility access modes and flags: The mode consists of 11 characters that
are interpreted as follows. The first two characters are:

.RE

The next nine characters are interpreted as three sets of three bits each. The
first set refers to the owner's permissions; the next to permissions of others
in the user-group of the facility entry; and the last to all others. Within
each set, the first character indicates permission to read, the second
character indicates permission to write or alter the facility entry, and the
last character is currently unused.
