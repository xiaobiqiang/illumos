.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlocaledef\fR utility converts source definitions for locale categories
into a format usable by the functions and utilities whose operational behavior
is determined by the setting of the locale environment variables; see
\fBenviron\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The utility reads source definitions for one or more locale categories
belonging to the same locale from the file named in the \fB-i\fR option (if
specified) or from standard input.
.sp
.LP
Each category source definition is identified by the corresponding environment
variable name and terminated by an \fBEND\fR \fIcategory-name\fR statement. The
following categories are supported.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBLC_CTYPE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Defines character classification and case conversion.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBLC_COLLATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Defines collation rules.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBLC_MONETARY\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Defines the format and symbols used in formatting of monetary information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBLC_NUMERIC\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Defines the decimal delimiter, grouping and grouping symbol for non-monetary
numeric editing.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBLC_TIME\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Defines the format and content of date and time information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBLC_MESSAGES\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Defines the format and values of affirmative and negative responses.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Creates permanent output even if warning messages have been issued.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Emit verbose debugging output on standard output.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-U\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Ignore the presence of character symbols that have no matching character
definition.  This facilitates the use of a common locale definition file
to be used across multiple encodings, even when some symbols are not
present in a given encoding.
.sp
Support for this option is an illumos extension.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIcharmap\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Specifies the pathname of a file containing a mapping of character symbols and
collating element symbols to actual character encodings. This option must be
specified if symbolic names (other than collating symbols defined in a
\fBcollating-symbol\fR keyword) are used. If the \fB-f\fR option is not
present, the default character mapping will be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-w\fR \fIwidthfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
The path name of the file containing character screen width definitions.
If not supplied, then default screen widths will be assumed, which will
generally not account for East Asian encodings requiring more than a single
character cell to display, nor for combining or accent marks that occupy
no additional screen width.
.sp
The support for width files is an illumos extension.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIsourcefile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
The path name of a file containing the source definitions. If this option is
not present, source definitions will be read from standard input.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fIcode_set_name\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Specifies the name of a codeset used as the target mapping of character symbols
and collating element symbols whose encoding values are defined in terms of the
ISO/IEC 10646-1: 2000 standard position constant values. See NOTES.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIlocalename\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
Identifies the locale. If the name contains one or more slash characters,
\fIlocalename\fR will be interpreted as a path name where the created locale
definitions will be stored. This capability may be restricted to users with
appropriate privileges. (As a consequence of specifying one \fIlocalename\fR,
although several categories can be processed in one execution, only categories
belonging to the same locale can be processed.)
.RE

.SH OUTPUT
.LP
\fBlocaledef\fR creates a directory of files that represents the locale's
data. The contents of this directory should generally be copied into the
appropriate subdirectory of /usr/lib/locale in order the definitions to
be visible to programs linked with libc.
.sp
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for definitions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBlocaledef\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
No errors occurred and the locales were successfully created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Warnings occurred and the locales were successfully created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
The locale specification exceeded implementation limits or the coded character
set or sets used were not supported by the implementation, and no locale was
created.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB>3\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Warnings or errors occurred and no output was created.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If an error is detected, no permanent output will be created.
.SH FILES
.ne 2
.na
\fB/usr/lib/locale/\fR\fIlocalename\fR\fB/\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The directory containing locale data.
.RE

.SH WARNINGS
.LP
If warnings occur, permanent output will be created if the \fB-c\fR option was
specified. The following conditions will cause warning messages to be issued:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If a symbolic name not found in the \fIcharmap\fR file is used for the
descriptions of the \fBLC_CTYPE\fR or \fBLC_COLLATE\fR categories (for other
categories, this will be an error condition).
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If optional keywords not supported by the implementation are present in the
source.
.RE
.SH NOTES
.LP
When the \fB-u\fR option is used, the \fIcode_set_name\fR option-argument is
interpreted as a name of a codeset to which the ISO/IEC 10646-1: 2000 standard
position constant values are converted. Both the ISO/IEC 10646-1: 2000 standard
position constant values and other formats (decimal, hexadecimal, or octal) are
valid as encoding values within the charmap file. The codeset can be any
codeset that is supported by the \fBiconv_open\fR(3C) function on the system.
.sp
.LP
When conflicts occur between the charmap specification of \fIcode_set_name\fR,
\fImb_cur_max\fR, or \fImb_cur_min\fR and the corresponding value for the
codeset represented by the \fB-u\fR option-argument \fIcode_set_name\fR, the
\fBlocaledef\fR utility fails as an error.
.sp
.LP
When conflicts occur between the charmap encoding values specified for symbolic
names of characters of the portable character set and the character encoding
values defined by the US-ASCII, the result is unspecified.
