.SH NAME
in.comsat, comsat \- biff server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/in.comsat\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBcomsat\fR is the server process which listens for reports of incoming mail
and notifies users who have requested to be told when mail arrives. It is
invoked as needed by \fBinetd\fR(1M), and times out if inactive for a few
minutes.
.sp
.LP
\fBcomsat\fR listens on a datagram port associated with the \fBbiff\fR service
specification (see \fBservices\fR(4)) for one line messages of the form
.sp
.LP
\fIuser\fR\fB@\fR\fImailbox\fR\fB-\fR\fIoffset\fR
.sp
.LP
If the \fIuser\fR specified is logged in to the system and the associated
terminal has the owner execute bit turned on (by a \fBbiff y\fR), the
\fIoffset\fR is used as a seek offset into the appropriate mailbox file, and
the first 7 lines or 560 characters of the message are printed on the user's
terminal.  Lines which appear to be part of the message header other than the
\fBFrom\fR, \fBTo\fR,  \fBDate\fR, or \fBSubject\fR lines are not printed when
displaying the message.
