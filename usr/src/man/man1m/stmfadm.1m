.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures logical units within the SCSI Target Mode Framework
.Pq STMF
framework.
The framework and this man page use the following terminology:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy initiator
A device responsible for issuing SCSI I/O commands to a SCSI target and logical
unit.
.It Sy target
A device responsible for receiving SCSI I/O commands for a logical unit.
.It Sy logical unit
A device within a target responsible for executing SCSI I/O commands.
.It Sy logical unit number
The identifier of a logical unit within a target.
.It Sy host group
An host group is a set of one or more initiators that are combined for the
purposes of being applied to a
.Sy view
.Pq see below .
An initiator cannot be a member of more than one host group.
.It Sy target group
A target group is a set of one or more SCSI target ports that are treated the
same when creating a
.Sy view
.Pq see below .
The set of logical units that a particular SCSI initiator can see is determined
by the combined set of views.
.Pp
Each logical unit has a set of view entries, and each view entry specifies a
target group, host group, and a LUN.
An initiator from that host group, when connecting through that target group, is
able to identify and connect to that logical unit using the specified LUN.
You can use views to restrict the set of logical units that a specific initiator
can see, and assign the set of LUNs that will be used.
.It Sy view
A view defines the association of a host group, a target group, and a logical
unit number with a specified logical unit.
Any view entry added to a logical unit must not be in conflict with existing
view entries for that logical unit.
A view entry is considered to be in conflict when an attempt is made to
duplicate the association of any given host, target and logical unit number.
.El
.Ss Logical Unit Properties
The following logical unit properties can be set only when creating LU using
.Cm create-lu
subcommand:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy blk Ns = Ns Ar num
Specifies the block size for the device.
The default is 512.
.It Sy guid Ns = Ns Ar string
32 hexadecimal ASCII characters representing a valid NAA Registered Extended
Identifier.
The default is set by the STMF to a generated value.
.It Sy meta Ns = Ns Ar path
Metadata file name.
When specified, will be used to hold the SCSI metadata for the logical unit.
There is no default.
.It Sy oui Ns = Ns Ar string
Organizational Unique Identifier.
Six hexadecimal ASCII characters representing the IEEE OUI company ID
assignment.
This will be used to generate the device identifier
.Pq GUID .
The default is
.Sy 00144F .
.It Sy pid Ns = Ns Ar string
16 bytes ASCII string defining Product ID per SCSI SPC-3.
This value will be reflected in the Standard INQUIRY data returned for the
device.
The default is
.Sy COMSTAR .
.It Sy serial Ns = Ns Ar string
Serial Number.
Specifies the SCSI Vital Product Data Serial Number
.Pq page 80h .
It is a character value up to 252 bytes in length.
There is no default value.
.It Sy vid Ns = Ns Ar string
8 bytes ASCII string defining Vendor ID per SCSI SPC-3.
This value will be reflected in the Standard INQUIRY data returned for the
device.
The default is
.Sy SUN .
.El
.Pp
The following logical unit properties can be set when creating LU using
.Cm create-lu
subcommand or modified using
.Cm modify-lu
subcommand:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy alias Ns = Ns Ar string
Up to 255 characters, representing a user-defined name for the device.
The default is the name of the backing store.
.It Sy mgmt-url Ns = Ns Ar string
Up to 1024 characters representing a Management Network Address URL.
More than one URL can be passed as a single parameter by using space-delimited
URLs enclosed inside a single pair of quotation marks
.Pq Sy \(dq .
.It Sy wcd Ns = Ns Sy true Ns | Ns Sy false
Write-back cache disable.
Determines write-back cache disable behavior.
The default is the write-back cache setting of the backing store device
specified by the
.Ar lu-file
argument.
.It Sy wp Ns = Ns Sy true Ns | Ns Sy false
Write-protect bit.
Determines whether the device reports as write-protected.
The default is
.Sy false .
.El
.Ss Subcommands
The
.Nm
command supports the subcommands listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm add-hg-member
.Fl g Ar host-group
.Ar initiator Ns ...
.Xc
Add a host group member to a host group.
.Pp
An initiator cannot be a member of more than one host group.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g Ns \&, Ns Fl -group-name Ar host-group
Specifies group name.
.Ar host-group
must be an existing group created using the
.Cm create-hg
subcommand.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm add-tg-member
.Fl g Ar target-group
.Ar target Ns ...
.Xc

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g Ns \&, Ns Fl -group-name Ar target-group
Specifies group name.
.Ar target-group
must be an existing group created using the
.Cm create-tg
subcommand.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm add-view
.Op Fl h Ar host-group
.Op Fl n Ar lu-number
.Op Fl t Ar target-group
.Ar lu-name
.Xc
Add a logical unit view entry to a logical unit
.Ar lu-name ,
where
.Ar lu-name
is the STMF name for the logical unit as displayed by the
.Cm list-lu
subcommand.
The
.Cm add-view
subcommand provides the user with a mechanism to implement access control for a
logical unit and also provides a means of assigning a logical unit number to a
logical unit for a given set of initiators and targets.
A logical unit will not be available to any initiators until at least one view
is applied.
Each view entry gets assigned an entry name, which can be used to reference the
entry in the
.Cm list-view
and
.Cm remove-view
subcommands.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h Ns \&, Ns Fl -host-group Ar host-group
.Ar host-group
is the name of an host group previously created using
.Cm create-hg
subcommand.
If this option is not specified, the logical unit will be available to all
initiators that log in to the STMF framework.
.It Fl n Ns \&, Ns Fl -lun Ar lu-number
.Ar lu-number
is an integer in the range 0-16383 to be assigned to the logical unit for this
view entry.
If this option is not specified, a logical unit number will be assigned by the
STMF framework.
.It Fl t Ns \&, Ns Fl -target-group Ar target-group
.Ar target-group
is the name of a target group previously created using
.Cm create-tg
subcommand.
If this option is not specified, the logical unit will be available through all
targets.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm create-hg
.Ar group-name
.Xc
Create a host group with the name
.Ar group-name .
.Ar group-name
is a string of Unicode characters with a maximum length of 255.
The group name must be unique within the STMF system.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm create-lu
.Oo Fl p Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value Oc Ns ...
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Ar lu-file
.Xc
Create a logical unit that can be registered with STMF.
.Ar lu-file
is the file to be used as the backing store for the logical unit.
If the
.Fl s
option is not specified, the size of the specified
.Ar lu-file
will be used as the size of the logical unit.
.Pp
Logical units registered with the STMF require space for the metadata to be
stored.
When a
.Sy zvol
is specified as the backing store device, the default will be to use a special
property of the
.Sy zvol
to contain the metadata.
For all other devices, the default behavior will be to use the first 64k of the
device.
An alternative approach would be to use the
.Sy meta
property in a
.Cm create-lu
subcommand to specify an alternate file to contain the metadata.
It is advisable to use a file that can provide sufficient storage of the logical
unit metadata, preferably 64k.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p Ns \&, Ns Fl -lu-prop Ar property Ns = Ns Ar value
Set specified logical unit property.
Check
.Sx Logical Unit Properties
for the list of available properties.
.It Fl s Ns \&, Ns Fl -size Ar size
.Ar size
is an integer followed by one of the following letters, to indicate a unit of
size:
.Sy k , m , g , t , p , e ,
specifying kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte and exabyte
respectively.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm create-tg
.Ar group-name
.Xc

.Ar group-name .
.Ar group-name

The group name must be unique within the STMF system.

.Ar lu-file
is the filename used in the
.Cm create-lu
subcommand.
If this logical unit is using a separate metadata file, the filename in the
