.TH GROUPMOD 1M "Jan 7, 2018"
.SH NAME
groupmod \- modify a group definition on the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/groupmod\fR [\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR [\fB-o\fR]] [\fB-n\fR \fIname\fR] \fIgroup\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBgroupmod\fR command modifies the definition of the specified group by
modifying the appropriate entry in the \fB/etc/group\fR file.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Specify the new group \fBID\fR for the group. This group \fBID\fR must be a
non-negative decimal integer less than \fBMAXUID\fR, as defined in
\fB<sys/param.h>\fR\&. The group \fBID\fR defaults to the next available
(unique) number above 99. (Group IDs from 0-99 are reserved for future
applications.)
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Specify the new name for the group.  The \fIname\fR argument is a string of no
more than eight bytes consisting of characters from the set of lower case
alphabetic characters and numeric characters.  A warning message will be
written if these restrictions are not met.  A future release may refuse
to accept group fields that do not meet these requirements.  The \fIname\fR
argument must contain at least one character and must not include a colon
(\fB:\fR) or \fBNEWLINE\fR (\fB\en\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Allow the \fIgid\fR to be duplicated (non-unique).
.RE

.SH NOTES
.LP
The \fBgroupmod\fR utility only modifies group definitions in the
\fB/etc/group\fR file. If a network name service
is being used to supplement the local \fB/etc/group\fR file with
additional entries, \fBgroupmod\fR cannot change information supplied by the
network name service. The \fBgroupmod\fR utility will, however, verify the
uniqueness of group name and group \fBID\fR against the external name service.
.sp
.LP
\fBgroupmod\fR fails if a group entry (a single line in \fB/etc/group\fR)
exceeds 2047 characters.
