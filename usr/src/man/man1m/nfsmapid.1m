.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsmapid
.Nd NFS user and group id mapping daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/lib/nfs/nfsmapid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon maps to and from NFS version 4
.Sy owner
and
.Sy owner_group
identification attributes and local UID and GID numbers used by both the NFS
version 4 client and server.
.Pp
.Nm
uses the
.Sy passwd
and
.Sy group
entries in the
.Pa /etc/nsswitch.conf
file to direct how it performs the mappings.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon has no external, customer-accessible interfaces.
You can, however, administratively configure
.Nm
in one of the following ways:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Set the
.Sy nfsmapid_domain
property for the
.Nm nfs
protocol using
.Xr sharectl 1M .
.It
Specify the
.Sy _nfsv4idmapdomain
DNS resource record.

.Sh NOTES
The
.Nm
service is managed by the service management facility,
.Xr smf 5 ,
under the service identifier:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
svc:/network/nfs/mapid
.Ed
.Pp
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or
requesting restart, can be performed using
.Xr svcadm 1M .
The service's status can be queried using the
.Xr svcs 1
command.
.Pp
If it is disabled, it will be enabled by
.Xr mount_nfs 1M ,
.Xr share_nfs 1M ,
and
.Xr automountd 1M ,
unless its
.Sy application Ns / Ns Sy auto_enable
property is set to
.Sy false .
.Pp
.Nm
caches a user's UID and GID.
If a user subsequently changes a UID or GID, using one of the utilities listed
below, the
.Nm
cache becomes stale.
At this point, any NFS operation that gets or set attributes will result in the
exchange of this stale information.
To resolve this situation, restart
.Nm ,
as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# svcadm restart svc:/network/nfs/mapid:default
.Ed
.Pp
The utilities that allow you to change UID and GID are:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Xr usermod 1M
.It
.Xr userdel 1M
.It
.Xr groupmod 1M
.It
.Xr groupdel 1M
.It
.Xr passmgmt 1M
