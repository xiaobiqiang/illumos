The \fBroledel\fR utility only deletes an account definition that is in the
local \fB/etc/group\fR, \fB/etc/passwd\fR, \fB/etc/shadow\fR, and
\fB/etc/user_attr\fR file. file. If a network name service
is being used to supplement the local \fB/etc/passwd\fR file with
additional entries, \fBroledel\fR cannot change information supplied by the
network name service.
