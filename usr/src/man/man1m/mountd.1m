.Sh NAME
.Nm mountd
.Nd server for NFS mount requests and NFS access checks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/lib/nfs/mountd
.Op Fl rv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an RPC server that answers requests for NFS access information and file
system mount requests.
It reads the file
.Pa /etc/dfs/sharetab
to determine which file systems are available for mounting by which remote
machines.
See
.Xr sharetab 4 .
.Nm nfsd
running on the local server will contact
.Nm
the first time an NFS client tries to access the file system to determine
whether the client should get read-write, read-only, or no access.
This access can be dependent on the security mode used in the remoted procedure
call from the client.
See
.Xr share_nfs 1M .
.Pp
The command also provides information as to what file systems are mounted by
which clients.
This information can be printed using the
.Xr showmount 1M
command.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon is automatically invoked by
.Xr share 1M .
.Pp
Only super user can run the mountd daemon.
.Pp
See
.Xr nfs 4
for available configuration properties for
.Nm .
.Ss Options
The options shown below are supported for NFSv2/v3 clients.
They are not supported for NFSv4 clients.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r
Reject mount requests from clients.
Clients that have file systems mounted will not be affected.
.It Fl v
Run the command in verbose mode.
Each time
.Nm
determines what access a client should get, it will log the result to the
console, as well as how it got that result.

.Sh NOTES
Since
.Nm
must be running for
.Nm nfsd
to function properly,
.Nm
is automatically started by the
.Sy svc:/network/nfs/server
service.
See
.Xr nfs 4 .
.Pp
Some routines that compare hostnames use case-sensitive string comparisons;
some do not.
If an incoming request fails, verify that the case of the hostname in the file
to be parsed matches the case of the hostname called for, and attempt the
request again.
