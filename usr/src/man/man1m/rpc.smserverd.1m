.SH NAME
rpc.smserverd \- removable media device server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/smedia/rpc.smserverd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBrpc.smserverd\fR is a server that handles requests from client
applications, such as volume management software or \fBrmformat\fR(1),
for access to removable media
devices. The \fBrpc.smserverd\fR daemon is started by
\fBinetd\fR(1M) when a client makes a call to a Solaris-internal library to
access a SCSI, IDE, or USB device. The daemon is not started if a client
attempts to access a floppy or PCMCIA device. Once started, the daemon remains
active until such time as it is idle for three minutes or more.

.LP
The \fBrpc.smserverd\fR daemon is provided for the exclusive use of the client
applications mentioned above. It has no external, customer-accessible
interfaces, including no configuration file.
