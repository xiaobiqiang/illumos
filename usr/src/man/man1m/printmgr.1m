.SH NAME
printmgr \- Solaris Print Manager is a graphical user interface for managing
printers in a network
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sadm/admin/bin/printmgr\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Solaris Print Manager is a Java-based graphical user interface that enables you
to manage local and remote printer access. This tool can be used in the
following name service environments: LDAP, NIS, and files. You must be
logged in as superuser to use this tool.
.sp
.LP
Using Solaris Printer Manager is the preferred method for managing printer
access because Solaris Print Manager centralizes printer information when it is
used in a name service environment.
.sp
.LP
Adding printer information to a name service makes access to printers available
to all systems on the network and generally makes printer administration easier
because all the information about printers is centralized.
.sp
.LP
Solaris Print Manager may be run on a remote system with the display sent to
the local system. See the \fISystem Administration Guide: Solaris Printing\fR
for instructions on setting the \fBDISPLAY\fR environment variable.
.sp
.LP
Using Solaris Print Manager to perform printer-related tasks automatically
updates the appropriate printer databases. Solaris Print Manager also includes
a command-line console that displays the \fBlp\fR command line for the add,
modify, and delete printer operations. Errors and warnings may also be
displayed when Printer Manager operations are performed.

server replication.

.LP
Although users can use the LDAP command line utilities \fBldapadd\fR(1) and
\fBldapmodify\fR(1) to update printer entries in the directory, the preferred
method is to use \fBlpset\fR. Otherwise, if the \fBlpadd\fR and \fBlpmodify\fR
utilities are used, the administrator must ensure that the \fBprinter-name\fR
attribute value is unique within the \fBou=printers\fR container on the LDAP
server. If the value is not unique, the result of modifications done using
\fBlpset\fR or the Solaris Print Manager, \fBprintmgr\fR may be unpredictable.
