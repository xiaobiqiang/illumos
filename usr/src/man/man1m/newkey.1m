.SH NAME
newkey \- create a new Diffie-Hellman key pair in the publickey database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBnewkey\fR \fB-h\fR \fIhostname\fR [\fB-s\fR nis | files | ldap]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBnewkey\fR \fB-u\fR \fIusername\fR [\fB-s\fR nis | files | ldap]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBnewkey\fR establishes new public keys for users and machines on the network.
These keys are needed when using secure \fBRPC\fR or secure \fBNFS\fR service.
.sp
.LP
\fBnewkey\fR prompts for a password for the given \fIusername\fR or
\fBhostname\fR and then creates a new public/secret Diffie-Hellman 192 bit key
pair for the user or host. The secret key is encrypted with the given password.
The key pair can be stored in the \fB/etc/publickey\fR file or the NIS
\fBpublickey\fR map.
.sp
.LP
\fBnewkey\fR consults the \fBpublickey\fR entry in the name service switch
configuration file (see \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4)) to determine which naming
service is used to store the secure \fBRPC\fR keys. If the \fBpublickey\fR
entry specifies a unique name service, \fBnewkey\fR will add the key in the
specified name service. However, if there are multiple name services listed,
\fBnewkey\fR cannot decide which source to update and will display an error
message. The user is required to specify the source explicitly with the
\fB-s\fR option.
.sp
.LP
In the case of NIS, \fBnewkey\fR should be run by the superuser on the master
NIS server for that domain.
.sp
.LP
In the case of LDAP, \fBnewkey\fR should be run by the superuser on a machine
that also recognizes the directory manager's bind distinguished name (DN) and
password to perform an LDAP update for the host.
