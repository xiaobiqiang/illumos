.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBmount\fR utility attaches a named resource, \fIresource\fR, to the file
system hierarchy at the path name location, \fImount-point\fR, which must
already exist.
.sp
.LP
If \fImount-point\fR has any contents prior to the \fBmount\fR operation, those
contents remain hidden until the resource is unmounted. An authorized user with
the \fBSYS_MOUNT\fR privilege can perform a \fBmount\fR operation. Also, a user
can perform SMBFS mount operations on a directory the user owns.
.sp
.LP
If the resource is listed in the \fB/etc/vfstab\fR file, you can specify either
\fIresource\fR or \fImount-point\fR as the \fBmount\fR command will consult the
\fB/etc/vfstab\fR file for more information. If the \fB-F\fR option is omitted,
\fBmount\fR takes the file system type from the entry in the \fB/etc/vfstab\fR
file.
.sp
.LP
If the resource is not listed in the \fB/etc/vfstab\fR file, the command line
must specify both \fIresource\fR and \fImount-point\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBumount\fR utility detaches a mounted file system from the file system
hierarchy. An authorized user with the \fBSYS_MOUNT\fR privilege can perform a
\fBumount\fR operation. Also, a user can perform SMBFS unmount operations on a
directory the user owns.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnetwork/smb/client\fR service must be enabled to successfully mount a
CIFS share. This service is enabled, by default.
.sp
.LP
To enable the service, enter the following \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsvcadm enable network/smb/client\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Operands"
.sp
.LP
The \fBmount\fR command supports the following operands:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIresource\fR
//[\fIworkgroup\fR;][\fIuser\fR[:\fIpassword\fR]@]\fIserver\fR/\fIshare\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
.sp
.LP
The name of the resource to be mounted. In addition to its name, you can
specify the following information about the resource:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIpassword\fR is the password associated with \fIuser\fR. If \fIpassword\fR is
not specified, the mount first attempts to use the password stored by the
\fBsmbutil login\fR command (if any). If that password fails to authenticate,
the \fBmount_smbfs\fR prompts you for a password.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIserver\fR is the DNS or NetBIOS name of the remote computer.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIshare\fR is the resource name on the remote server.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIuser\fR is the remote user name. If \fIuser\fR is omitted, the logged in
user ID is used.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
\fIworkgroup\fR is the name of the workgroup or the Windows domain in which the
user name is defined.
.sp
If the resource includes a workgroup, you must escape the semicolon that
appears after the workgroup name to prevent it from being interpreted by the
command shell. For instance, surround the entire resource name with double
quotes: \fBmount -F smbfs "//SALES;george@RSERVER" /mnt\fR.
.RE
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fImount-point\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The path to the location where the file system is to be mounted or unmounted.
The \fBmount\fR command maintains a table of mounted file systems in the
\fB/etc/mnttab\fR file. See the \fBmnttab\fR(4) man page.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
See the \fBmount\fR(1M) man page for the list of supported
\fIgeneric-options\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR or\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR \fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the file system-specific properties. You can specify more than one
name-value pair as a list of comma-separated pairs. No spaces are permitted in
the list. The properties are as follows:

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBacl\fR|\fBnoacl\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable (or disable) presentation of Access Control Lists (ACLs)
on files and directories under this \fBsmbfs\fR(7FS) mount.
The default behavior is \fBnoacl\fR, which presents files and
directories as owned by the owner of the mount point and having
permissions based on \fBfileperms\fR or \fBdirperms\fR.
With the \fBacl\fR mount option, files are presented with ACLs
obtained from the SMB server.
Setting the \fBacl\fR mount option is not advised unless the system
is joined to an Active Directory domain and using \fBldap\fR(1)
so it can correctly present ACL identities from the SMB server.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdirperms=\fR\fIoctaltriplet\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the permissions to be assigned to directories. The value must be
specified as an octal triplet, such as \fB755\fR. The default value for the
directory mode is taken from the \fBfileperms\fR setting, with execute
permission added where \fBfileperms\fR has read permission.
.sp
Note that these permissions have no relation to the rights granted by the CIFS
server.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBfileperms=\fR\fIoctaltriplet\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the permissions to be assigned to files. The value must be specified
as an octal triplet, such as \fB644\fR. The default value is \fB700\fR.
.sp
Note that these permissions have no relation to the rights granted by the CIFS
server.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBgid=\fR\fIgroupid\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Assigns the specified group ID to files. The default value is the group ID of
the directory where the volume is mounted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBintr\fR|\fBnointr\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable (or disable) cancellation of \fBsmbfs\fR(7FS) I/O operations when the
user interrupts the calling thread (for example, by hitting Ctrl-C while an
operation is underway). The default is \fBintr\fR (interruption enabled), so
cancellation is normally allowed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBnoprompt\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Suppresses the prompting for a password when mounting a share. This property
enables you to permit anonymous access to a share. Anonymous access does not
require a password.
.sp
The \fBmount\fR operation fails if a password is required, the \fBnoprompt\fR
property is set, and no password is stored by the \fBsmbutil login\fR command.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBretry_count=\fR\fInumber\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the number of SMBFS retries to attempt before the connection is
marked as broken. By default, 4 attempts are made.
.sp
The \fBretry_count\fR property value set by the \fBmount\fR command overrides
the global value set in SMF or the value set in your \fB\&.nsmbrc\fR file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBtimeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the CIFS request timeout. By default, the timeout is 15 seconds.
.sp
The \fBtimeout\fR property value set by the \fBmount\fR command overrides the
global value set in SMF or the value set in your \fB\&.nsmbrc\fR file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBuid=\fR\fIuserid\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Assigns the specified user ID files. The default value is the owner ID of the
directory where the volume is mounted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBxattr\fR|\fBnoxattr\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enable (or disable) Solaris Extended Attributes in this mount point. This
option defaults to \fBxattr\fR (enabled Extended Attributes), but note: if the
CIFS server does not support CIFS "named streams", \fBsmbfs\fR(7FS) forces this
option to \fBnoxattr\fR. When a mount has the \fBnoxattr\fR option, attempts to
use Solaris Extended attributes fail with EINVAL.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-O\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Overlays mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over an existing mount
point, making the underlying file system inaccessible. If a mount is attempted
on a pre-existing mount point without setting this flag, the mount fails,
producing the error "device busy."

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The Solaris CIFS client always attempts to use \fBgethostbyname()\fR to resolve
host names. If the host name cannot be resolved, the CIFS client uses NetBIOS
name resolution (NBNS). By default, the Solaris CIFS client permits the use of
NBNS to enable Solaris CIFS clients in Windows environments to work without
additional configuration.
.sp
.LP
Since NBNS has been exploited in the past, you might want to disable it. To
disable NBNS, set the \fBnbns-enabled\fR service management facility property
to \fBfalse\fR. By default, \fBnbns-enabled\fR is set to \fBtrue\fR.
.sp
.LP
If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link,
the file system is mounted on the directory to which the symbolic link refers,
rather than being mounted on top of the symbolic link itself.
