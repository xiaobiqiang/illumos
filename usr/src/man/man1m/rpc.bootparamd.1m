.SH NAME
rpc.bootparamd, bootparamd \- boot parameter server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/rpc.bootparamd\fR [\fB-d\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.bootparamd\fR is a server process that provides information from a
\fBbootparams\fR database to diskless clients at boot time. See
\fBbootparams\fR(4)
.sp
.LP
The source for the \fBbootparams\fR database is determined by the
\fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4) file (on the machine running the \fBrpc.bootparamd\fR
process).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
A diskless client requires service from at least one \fBrpc.bootparamd\fR
process running on a server that is on the same IP subnetwork as the diskless
client.
.sp
.LP
Some routines that compare hostnames use case-sensitive string comparisons;
some do not. If an incoming request fails, verify that the case of the
hostname in the file to be parsed matches the case of the hostname called  for,
and attempt the request again.
.sp
.LP
The \fBrpc.bootparamd\fR service is managed by the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/rpc/bootparams
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or
requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). The service's
status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
