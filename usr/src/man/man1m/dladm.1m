.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBdladm\fR command is used to administer data-links. A data-link is
represented in the system as a \fBSTREAMS DLPI\fR (v2) interface which can be
plumbed under protocol stacks such as \fBTCP/IP\fR. Each data-link relies on
either a single network device or an aggregation of devices to send packets to
or receive packets from a network.
.sp
.LP
Each \fBdladm\fR subcommand operates on one of the following objects:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlink\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A datalink, identified by a name. In general, the name can use any alphanumeric
characters (or the underscore, \fB_\fR), but must start with an alphabetic
character and end with a number. A datalink name can be at most 31 characters,
and the ending number must be between 0 and 4294967294 (inclusive). The ending
number must not begin with a zero. Datalink names between 3 and 8 characters
are recommended.
.sp
Some subcommands operate only on certain types or classes of datalinks. For
those cases, the following object names are used:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBphys-link\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A physical datalink.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBvlan-link\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A VLAN datalink.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBaggr-link\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An aggregation datalink (or a key; see NOTES).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBether-link\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A physical Ethernet datalink.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwifi-link\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A WiFi datalink.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBvnic-link\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A virtual network interface created on a link or an \fBetherstub\fR. It is a
pseudo device that can be treated as if it were an network interface card on a
machine.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBiptun-link\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An IP tunnel link.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdev\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A network device, identified by concatenation of a driver name and an instance
number.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBetherstub\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
An Ethernet stub can be used instead of a physical NIC to create VNICs. VNICs
created on an \fBetherstub\fR will appear to be connected through a virtual
switch, allowing complete virtual networks to be built without physical
hardware.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBbridge\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A bridge instance, identified by an administratively-chosen name. The name may
use any alphanumeric characters or the underscore, \fB_\fR, but must start and
end with an alphabetic character. A bridge name can be at most 31 characters.
The name \fBdefault\fR is reserved, as are all names starting with \fBSUNW\fR.
.sp
Note that appending a zero (\fB0\fR) to a bridge name produces a valid link
name, used for observability.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsecobj\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A secure object, identified by an administratively-chosen name. The name can
use any alphanumeric characters, as well as underscore (\fB_\fR), period
(\fB\&.\fR), and hyphen (\fB-\fR). A secure object name can be at most 32
characters.
.RE

.SS "Options"
.LP
Each \fBdladm\fR subcommand has its own set of options. However, many of the
subcommands have the following as a common option:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIroot-dir\fR, \fB--root-dir\fR=\fIroot-dir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies an alternate root directory where the operation-such as creation,
deletion, or renaming-should apply.
.RE

.SS "SUBCOMMANDS"
.LP
The following subcommands are supported:
.sp

.ad
.sp .6

datalinks or for the specified link \fIlink\fR. By default, the system is

Specifies one or more links to add to the newly-created bridge. This is similar
to creating the bridge and then adding one or more links, as with the

entire command fails, and the new bridge itself is not created. To add multiple
links on the same command line, repeat this option for each link. You are
permitted to create bridges without links. For more information about link
assignments, see the \fBadd-bridge\fR subcommand.

.SS "Parsable Output Format"

Many \fBdladm\fR subcommands have an option that displays output in a

When you request multiple fields, any literal colon characters are escaped by a
backslash (\fB\e\fR) before being output. Similarly, literal backslash
characters will also be escaped (\fB\e\e\fR). This escape format is parsable

Each \fBadv_\fR property (for example, \fBadv_10fdx_cap\fR) also has a
read/write counterpart \fBen_\fR property (for example, \fBen_10fdx_cap\fR)
controlling parameters used at auto-negotiation. In the absence of Power
Management, the \fBadv\fR* speed/duplex parameters provide the values that are
both negotiated and currently effective in hardware. However, with Power
Management enabled, the speed/duplex capabilities currently exposed in hardware
might be a subset of the set of bits that were used in initial link parameter
negotiation. Thus the MII \fBadv_\fR* parameters are marked read-only, with an
additional set of \fBen_\fR* parameters for configuring speed and duplex
properties at initial negotiation.

Note that the \fBadv_autoneg_cap\fR does not have an \fBen_autoneg_cap\fR

\fBExample 19 \fRCreating an IPv4 Tunnel
.sp
.LP
The following sequence of commands creates and then displays a persistent IPv4
tunnel link named \fBmytunnel0\fR between 66.1.2.3 and 192.4.5.6:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBdladm create-iptun -T ipv4 -s 66.1.2.3 -d 192.4.5.6 mytunnel0\fR
# \fBdladm show-iptun mytunnel0\fR
LINK            TYPE  FLAGS  SOURCE              DESTINATION
mytunnel0       ipv4  --     66.1.2.3            192.4.5.6
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
A point-to-point IP interface can then be created over this tunnel link:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBifconfig mytunnel0 plumb 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2 up\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
As with any other IP interface, configuration persistence for this IP interface
is achieved by placing the desired \fBifconfig\fR commands (in this case, the
command for "\fB10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2\fR") into \fB/etc/hostname.mytunnel0\fR.

.LP
\fBExample 20 \fRCreating a 6to4 Tunnel
.sp
.LP
The following command creates a 6to4 tunnel link. The IPv4 address of the 6to4
router is 75.10.11.12.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBdladm create-iptun -T 6to4 -s 75.10.11.12 sitetunnel0\fR
# \fBdladm show-iptun sitetunnel0\fR
LINK            TYPE  FLAGS  SOURCE              DESTINATION
sitetunnel0     6to4  --     75.10.11.12         --
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The following command plumbs an IPv6 interface on this tunnel:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBifconfig sitetunnel0 inet6 plumb up\fR
# \fBifconfig sitetunnel0 inet6\fR
sitetunnel0: flags=2200041 <UP,RUNNING,NONUD,IPv6> mtu 65515 index 3
        inet tunnel src 75.10.11.12
        tunnel hop limit 64
        inet6 2002:4b0a:b0c::1/16
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Note that the system automatically configures the IPv6 address on the 6to4 IP
interface. See \fBifconfig\fR(1M) for a description of how IPv6 addresses are
configured on 6to4 tunnel links.

.SH NOTES
.LP
The preferred method of referring to an aggregation in the aggregation
subcommands is by its link name. Referring to an aggregation by its integer
\fIkey\fR is supported for backward compatibility, but is not necessary. When
creating an aggregation, if a \fIkey\fR is specified instead of a link name,
the aggregation's link name will be automatically generated by \fBdladm\fR as
\fBaggr\fR\fIkey\fR.
