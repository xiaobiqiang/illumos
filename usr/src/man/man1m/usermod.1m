.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBusermod\fR utility modifies a user's login definition on the system. It
changes the definition of the specified login and makes the appropriate
login-related system file and file system changes.
.sp
.LP
The system file entries created with this command have a limit of 512
characters per line. Specifying long arguments to several options can exceed
this limit.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR \fIauthorization\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
One or more comma separated authorizations as defined in \fBauth_attr\fR(4).
Only a user or role who has \fBgrant\fR rights to the \fBauthorization\fR can
assign it to an account. This replaces any existing authorization setting. If
an empty authorization list is specified, the existing setting is removed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIcomment\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify a comment string. \fIcomment\fR can be any text string. It is generally
a short description of the login, and is currently used as the field for the
user's full name. This information is stored in the user's \fB/etc/passwd\fR
entry.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIdir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the new home directory of the user. It defaults to
\fIbase_dir/login\fR, where \fIbase_dir\fR is the base directory for new login
home directories, and \fBlogin\fR is the new login.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR \fIexpire\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the expiration date for a login. After this date, no user will be able
to access this login. The expire option argument is a date entered using one of
the date formats included in the template file \fB/etc/datemsk\fR. See
\fBgetdate\fR(3C).
.sp
For example, you may enter \fB10/6/90\fR or \fBOctober 6, 1990\fR. A value of
\fB`` ''\fR defeats the status of the expired date.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIinactive\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the maximum number of days allowed between uses of a login \fBID\fR
before that login \fBID\fR is declared invalid. Normal values are positive
integers. A value of \fB0\fR defeats the status.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-g\fR \fIgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify an existing group's integer \fBID\fR or character-string name. It
redefines the user's primary group membership.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-G\fR \fIgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
One or more comma-separated existing groups, specified by integer \fBID\fR or
character-string name. It redefines the user's supplementary group membership.
Any duplicate groups between the \fB-g\fR and \fB-G\fR options are ignored.
No more than \fBNGROUPS_UMAX\fR groups may be specified as defined in
\fB<sys/param.h>\fR\&.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-K\fR \fIkey=value\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Replace existing or add to a user's \fIkey=value\fR pair attributes. Multiple
\fB-K\fR options can be used to replace or add multiple \fIkey=value\fR pairs.
However, keys must not be repeated. The generic \fB-K\fR option with the
appropriate key can be used instead of the specific implied key options
(\fB-A\fR, \fB-P\fR, \fB-R\fR, \fB-p\fR). See \fBuser_attr\fR(4) for a list of
valid \fIkey\fRs. Values for these keys are usually found in man pages or other
sources related to those keys. For example, see \fBproject\fR(4) for guidance
on values for the \fBproject\fR key. Use the command \fBppriv\fR(1) with the
\fB-v\fR and \fB-l\fR options for a list of values for the keys
\fBdefaultpriv\fR and \fBlimitpriv\fR.
.sp
The keyword \fBtype\fR can be specified with the value \fBrole\fR or the value
\fBnormal\fR.  When using the value \fBrole\fR, the account changes from a
normal user to a role; using the value \fBnormal\fR keeps the account a normal
user.
.sp
As a \fBrole\fR account, no roles (\fB-R\fR or \fIroles=value\fR) can be
present.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR \fInew_logname\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the new login name for the user. See \fBpasswd\fR(4) for the
requirements for usernames.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR [\fB-z|-Z\fR]
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Move the user's home directory to the new directory specified with the \fB-d\fR
option. If the directory already exists, it must have permissions
read/write/execute by \fIgroup\fR, where \fIgroup\fR is the user's primary
group.
.sp
If the user's old home directory was located on a separate \fBZFS\fR file system
and the \fB/etc/default/useradd\fR file contains the parameter \fBMANAGE_ZFS\fR
set to the value \fBYES\fR, the file system will be destroyed after the home
directory is moved. If the parent directory of the user's new home directory is
located on a separate \fBZFS\fR filesystem and the \fB/etc/default/useradd\fR
file contains the parameter \fBMANAGE_ZFS\fR set to the value \fBYES\fR, a new
\fBZFS\fR file system will be created.
.sp
If the \fB-z\fR option is specified, \fBusermod\fR will always try to create a
new file system for the home directory and destroy the old one.
.sp
If the \fB-Z\fR option is specified, a new file system will never be created,
and the old one will never be destroyed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This option allows the specified \fBUID\fR to be duplicated (non-unique).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR \fIprofile\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
One or more comma-separated execution profiles defined in \fBprof_attr\fR(4).
This replaces any existing profile setting in \fBuser_attr\fR(4). If an empty
profile list is specified, the existing setting is removed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIrole\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
One or more comma-separated roles (see \fBroleadd\fR(1M)). This replaces any
existing role setting. If an empty role list is specified, the existing setting
is removed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIshell\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify the full pathname of the program that is used as the user's shell on
login. The value of \fIshell\fR must be a valid executable file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fIuid\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify a new \fBUID\fR for the user. It must be a non-negative decimal integer
less than \fBMAXUID\fR as defined in \fB<sys/param.h>\fR\&. The \fBUID\fR
associated with the user's home directory is not modified with this option; a
user will not have access to their home directory until the \fBUID\fR is
manually reassigned using \fBchown\fR(1).
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2

.SH NOTES
.LP
The \fBusermod\fR utility modifies \fBpasswd\fR definitions only in the local
\fB/etc/passwd\fR and \fB/etc/shadow\fR files. If a network nameservice
is being used to supplement the local files with
additional entries, \fBusermod\fR cannot change information supplied by the
network nameservice. However \fBusermod\fR will verify the uniqueness of user
name and user \fBID\fR against the external nameservice.
.sp
.LP
The \fBusermod\fR utility uses the \fB/etc/datemsk\fR file
for date formatting.
