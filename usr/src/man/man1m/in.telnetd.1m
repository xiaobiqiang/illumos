.SH NAME
in.telnetd, telnetd \- DARPA TELNET protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/in.telnetd\fR [\fB-a\fR \fIauthmode\fR] [\fB-EXUh\fR] [\fB-s\fR \fItos\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBin.telnetd\fR is a server that supports the \fBDARPA\fR standard
\fBTELNET\fR virtual terminal protocol. \fBin.telnetd\fR is normally invoked in
the internet server (see \fBinetd\fR(1M)), for requests to connect to the
\fBTELNET\fR port as indicated by the \fB/etc/services\fR file (see
\fBservices\fR(4)).
.sp
.LP
\fBin.telnetd\fR operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device for a client,
then creating a login process which has the slave side of the pseudo-terminal
as its standard input, output, and error. \fBin.telnetd\fR manipulates the
master side of the pseudo-terminal, implementing the \fBTELNET\fR protocol and
passing characters between the remote client and the login process.
.sp
.LP
When a \fBTELNET\fR session starts up, \fBin.telnetd\fR sends \fBTELNET\fR
options to the client side indicating a willingness to do \fIremote\fR
\fBecho\fR of characters, and to \fIsuppress\fR \fIgo\fR \fIahead\fR. The
pseudo-terminal allocated to the client is configured to operate in "cooked"
mode, and with \fBXTABS\fR, \fBICRNL\fR and \fBONLCR\fR enabled. See
\fBtermio\fR(7I).
.sp
.LP
\fBin.telnetd\fR is willing to do: \fIecho\fR, \fIbinary\fR, \fIsuppress\fR
\fIgo\fR \fIahead\fR, and \fItiming\fR \fImark\fR. \fBin.telnetd\fR is willing
to have the remote client do: \fIbinary\fR, \fIterminal\fR \fItype\fR,
\fIterminal\fR \fIsize\fR, \fIlogout\fR \fIoption\fR, and \fIsuppress\fR
\fIgo\fR \fIahead\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.telnetd\fR also allows environment variables to be passed, provided that
the client negotiates this during the initial option negotiation. The
\fBDISPLAY\fR environment variable may be sent this way, either by the
\fBTELNET\fR general environment passing methods, or by means of the
\fBXDISPLOC\fR \fBTELNET\fR option. \fBDISPLAY\fR can be passed in the
environment option during the same negotiation where \fBXDISPLOC\fR is used.
Note that if you use both methods, use the same value for both. Otherwise, the
results may be unpredictable.
.sp
.LP
These options are specified in Internet standards \fIRFC 1096\fR, \fIRFC
1408\fR, \fIRFC 1510\fR, \fIRFC 1571\fR, \fIRFC 2941\fR, \fIRFC 2942\fR, \fIRFC
2946\fR, and \fIRFC 1572\fR. The following Informational draft is also
supported: \fIRFC 2952\fR.
.sp
.LP
The banner printed by \fBin.telnetd\fR is configurable. The default is (more or
less) equivalent to `\fBuname\fR \fB-sr\fR` and will be used if no banner is
set in \fB/etc/default/telnetd\fR. To set the banner, add a line of the form
.sp
.in +2
.nf
BANNER="..."
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
to \fB/etc/default/telnetd\fR. Nonempty banner strings are fed to shells for
evaluation. The default banner may be obtained by
.sp
.in +2
.nf
BANNER="\e\er\e\en\e\er\e\en`uname -s` `uname -r`\e\er\e\en\e\er\e\en"

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR \fIauthmode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
This option may be used for specifying what mode should be used for
authentication. There are several valid values for \fIauthmode\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBvalid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Only allows connections when the remote user can provide valid authentication
information to identify the remote user, and is allowed access to the specified
account without providing a password.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBuser\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
Only allows connections when the remote user can provide valid authentication
information to identify the remote user. The \fBlogin\fR(1) command will
provide any additional user verification needed if the remote user is not
allowed automatic access to the specified account.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBnone\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
This is the default state. Authentication information is not required. If no or
insufficient authentication information is provided, then the \fBlogin\fR(1)
program provides the necessary user verification.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBoff\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
This disables the authentication code. All user verification happens through
the \fBlogin\fR(1) program.

.SH USAGE
.LP
\fBtelnetd\fR and \fBin.telnetd\fR are IPv6-enabled. See \fBip6\fR(7P).
.SH SECURITY
.LP
\fBin.telnetd\fR can authenticate using Kerberos V5 authentication,
\fBpam\fR(3PAM), or both. By default, the telnet server will accept valid
Kerberos V5 authentication credentials from a \fBtelnet\fR client that supports
Kerberos. \fBin.telnetd\fR can also support an encrypted session from such a
client if the client requests it.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtelnet\fR protocol only uses single DES for session
protection\(emclients request service tickets with single DES session keys. The
KDC must know that host service principals that offer the \fBtelnet\fR service
support single DES, which, in practice, means that such principals must have
single DES keys in the KDC database.
.sp
.LP
In order for Kerberos authentication to work, a \fBhost/\fR\fI<FQDN>\fR
Kerberos principal must exist for each Fully Qualified Domain Name associated
with the \fBtelnetd\fR server. Each of these \fBhost/\fR\fI<FQDN>\fR principals
must have a \fBkeytab\fR entry in the \fB/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab\fR file on the
\fBtelnetd\fR server. An example principal might be:
.sp
.LP
\fBhost/bigmachine.eng.example.com\fR
.sp
.LP
See \fBkadmin\fR(1M) for instructions on adding a principal to a
\fBkrb5.keytab\fR file. See \fI\fR for a discussion of Kerberos
authentication.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.telnetd\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for authentication, account management,
session management, and password management. The \fBPAM\fR configuration
policy, listed through \fB/etc/pam.conf\fR, specifies the modules to be used
for \fBin.telnetd\fR. Here is a partial \fBpam.conf\fR file with entries for
the \fBtelnet\fR command using the UNIX authentication, account management,
session management, and password management modules.
.sp

.fi

.sp
.LP
If there are no entries for the \fBtelnet\fR service, then the entries for the
"other" service will be used. If multiple authentication modules are listed,
then the user may be prompted for multiple passwords.
.sp
.LP
For a Kerberized telnet service, the correct \fBPAM\fR service name is
\fBktelnet\fR.

.SH NOTES
.LP
Some \fBTELNET\fR commands are only partially implemented.
.sp
.LP
Binary mode has no common interpretation except between similar operating
systems.
.sp
.LP
The terminal type name received from the remote client is converted to lower
case.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpacket\fR interface to the pseudo-terminal should be used for more
intelligent flushing of input and output queues.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.telnetd\fR never sends \fBTELNET\fR \fIgo\fR \fIahead\fR commands.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_unix\fR(5) module is no longer supported.. Similar functionality is
provided by \fBpam_authtok_check\fR(5), \fBpam_authtok_get\fR(5),
\fBpam_authtok_store\fR(5), \fBpam_dhkeys\fR(5), \fBpam_passwd_auth\fR(5),
\fBpam_unix_account\fR(5), \fBpam_unix_auth\fR(5), and
\fBpam_unix_session\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.telnetd\fR service is managed by the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2

svc:/network/telnet
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or
requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). Responsibility for
initiating and restarting this service is delegated to \fBinetd\fR(1M). Use
\fBinetadm\fR(1M) to make configuration changes and to view configuration
information for this service. The service's status can be queried using the
\fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
