.SH NAME
in.uucpd, uucpd \- UUCP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/in.uucpd\fR [\fB-n\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBin.uucpd\fR is the server for supporting \fBUUCP\fR connections over
networks.
.sp
.LP
\fBin.uucpd\fR is invoked by \fBinetd\fR(1M) when a \fBUUCP\fR connection is
established, that is, a connection to the port indicated in the "uucp" service
specification, and executes the following protocol. See \fBservices\fR(4):
.RS +4
.TP
1.
The server prompts with \fBlogin:\fR. The \fBuucico\fR(1M) process at the
other end must supply a username.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
2.
Unless the username refers to an account without a password, the server then
prompts with \fBPassword:\fR. The \fBuucico\fR process at the other end must
supply the password for that account.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If the username is not valid, or is valid but refers to an account that does
not have \fB/usr/lib/uucp/uucico\fR as its login shell, or if the password is
not the correct password for that account, the connection is dropped.
Otherwise, \fBuucico\fR is run, with the user \fBID\fR, group \fBID\fR, group
set, and home directory for that account, with the environment variables
\fBUSER\fR and \fB LOGNAME\fR set to the specified username, and with a
\fB-u\fR flag specifying the username. Unless the \fB-n\fR flag is specified,
entries are made in \fB/var/adm/utmpx\fR, \fB/var/adm/wtmpx\fR, and
\fB/var/adm/lastlog\fR for the username. \fBin.uucpd\fR must be invoked by a
user with appropriate privilege (usually root) in order to be able to verify
that the password is correct.
.SH SECURITY
.sp
.LP
\fBin.uucpd\fR uses \fBpam\fR(3PAM) for authentication, account management, and
session management.  The \fBPAM\fR configuration policy, listed through
\fB/etc/pam.conf\fR, specifies the modules to be used for \fBin.uucpd\fR. Here
is a partial \fBpam.conf\fR file with entries for \fBuucp\fR using the UNIX
authentication, account management, and session management module.

If there are no entries for the \fBuucp\fR service, then the entries for the
"other" service will be used. If multiple authentication modules are listed,
then the peer may be prompted for multiple passwords.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.uucpd\fR service is managed by the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/uucp
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or
requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). Responsibility for
initiating and restarting this service is delegated to \fBinetd\fR(1M). Use
\fBinetadm\fR(1M) to make configuration changes and to view configuration
information for this service. The service's status can be queried using the
\fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpam_unix\fR(5) module is no longer supported. Similar functionality is
provided by \fBpam_authtok_check\fR(5), \fBpam_authtok_get\fR(5),
\fBpam_authtok_store\fR(5), \fBpam_dhkeys\fR(5), \fBpam_passwd_auth\fR(5),
\fBpam_unix_account\fR(5), \fBpam_unix_auth\fR(5), and
\fBpam_unix_session\fR(5).
