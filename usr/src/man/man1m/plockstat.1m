.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBplockstat\fR utility gathers and displays user-level locking statistics.
By default, \fBplockstat\fR monitors all lock contention events, gathers
frequency and timing data about those events, and displays the data in
decreasing frequency order, so that the most common events appear first.
.sp
.LP
\fBplockstat\fR gathers data until the specified command completes or the
process specified with the \fB-p\fR option completes.
.sp
.LP
\fBplockstat\fR relies on DTrace to instrument a running process or a command
it invokes to trace events of interest. This imposes a small but measurable
performance overhead on the processes being observed. Users must have the
\fBdtrace_proc\fR privilege and have permission to observe a particular process
with \fBplockstat\fR. Refer to the \fI\fR for more information about DTrace
security features.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-A\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Watch all lock events. This option is equivalent to \fB-CH\fR.
.RE

.RS 16n
Exit after the number of seconds specified have elapsed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIcount\fR\fR

Display only the specified number of entries for each output category.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR \fIdepth\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Record a stack trace rather than just the calling function.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fIpid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Specify a process ID from which \fBplockstat\fR is to gather data.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na

.ad
.RS 16n
Print out a message to indicate that tracing has started.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR \fIarg\fR[=\fIval\fR]\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Enable or modify a DTrace runtime option or D compiler option. The list of
options is found in the \fIDynamic Tracing Guide\fR. Boolean options
are enabled by specifying their name. Options with values are set by separating
the option name and value with an equals sign (\fB=\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-V\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
Print the Dtrace commands used to gather the data. The output can then be used
