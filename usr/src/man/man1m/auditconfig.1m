.SH NAME
auditconfig \- configure auditing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBauditconfig\fR \fIoption\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBauditconfig\fR provides a command line interface to get and set kernel audit
parameters.
.sp
.LP
The setting of the \fBperzone\fR policy determines the scope of the audit
setting controlled by \fBauditconfig\fR. If \fBperzone\fR is set, then the
values reflect the local zone except as noted. Otherwise, the settings are for
the entire system. Any restriction based on the \fBperzone\fR setting is noted
for each option to which it applies.
.sp
.LP
A non-global zone administrator can set all audit policy options except
\fBperzone\fR and \fBahlt\fR. \fBperzone\fR and \fBahlt\fR apply only to the
global zone; setting these policies requires the privileges of a global zone
administrator. \fBperzone\fR and \fBahlt\fR are described under the
\fB-setpolicy\fR option, below.
.SH OPTIONS
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-aconf\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set the non-attributable audit mask to the value set using the
\fB-setnaflags\fR option. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# auditconfig -aconf
Configured non-attributable event mask.

\fB\fB-audit\fR \fIevent\fR \fIsorf\fR \fIretval\fR \fIstring\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This command constructs an audit record for audit event \fIevent\fR using the
process's audit characteristics containing a text token \fIstring\fR. The
return token is constructed from the \fIsorf\fR (success/failure flag) and the
\fIretval\fR (return value). The event is type \fBchar*\fR, the \fIsorf\fR is
0/1 for success/failure, \fIretval\fR is an errno value, \fIstring\fR is type
\fB*char\fR. This command is useful for constructing an audit record with a
shell script. An example of this option:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# auditconfig -audit AUE_ftpd 0 0 "test string"
#

audit record from audit trail:

.SH NOTES
.LP
If the \fBaudit_remote\fR or \fBaudit_syslog\fR plugins are active, the
behavior of the system with respect to the \fB-setpolicy\fR \fB+cnt\fR and the
\fB-setqhiwater\fR options is modified slightly. If \fB-setpolicy\fR \fB+cnt\fR
is set, data will continue to be sent to the selected plugin, even though
output to the binary audit log is stopped, pending the freeing of disk space.
If \fB-setpolicy\fR \fB-cnt\fR is used, the blocking behavior is as described
under OPTIONS, above. The value set for the queue high water mark is used
within \fBauditd\fR as the default value for its queue limits unless overridden
by means of the \fBqsize\fR attribute.
.sp
.LP
The \fBauditconfig\fR options that modify or display process-based information
are not affected by the \fBperzone\fR policy. Those that modify system audit
data such as the terminal id and audit queue parameters are valid only in the
global zone, unless the \fBperzone\fR policy is set. The display of a system
audit reflects the local zone if \fBperzone\fR is set. Otherwise, it reflects
the settings of the global zone.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-setcond\fR option has been removed. Use \fBaudit\fR(1M) to enable or
disable auditing.
.sp
.LP
The \fB-getfsize\fR and \fB-setfsize\fR options have been removed. Use
\fBaudit_binfile\fR(5) \fBp_fsize\fR to set the audit file size.
