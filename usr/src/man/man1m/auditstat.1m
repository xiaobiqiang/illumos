This field is obsolete.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdrop\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
The total number of audit records that have been dropped. Records are dropped
according to the kernel audit policy. See \fBauditon\fR(2), \fBAUDIT_CNT\fR
policy for details.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBenq\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
The total number of audit records put on the kernel audit queue.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBgen\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n

written).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBkern\fR\fR

system calls).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmem\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
The total number of Kbytes of memory currently in use by the kernel audit
module.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBnona\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
The total number of non-attributable audit records that have been constructed.
These are audit records that are not attributable to any particular user.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBrblk\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
The total number of times that the audit queue has blocked waiting to process
audit data.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBtot\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwblk\fR\fR
.ad

high water mark.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwrtn\fR\fR
.ad

\fBwrtn\fR is the number of outstanding audit records on the audit queue that
have not been written.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIcount\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Display the statistics a total of \fIcount\fR times. If \fIcount\fR is equal to
zero, statistics are displayed indefinitely. A time interval must be specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR \fInumlines\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Display a header for every \fInumlines\fR of statistics printed. The default is
to display the header every 20 lines. If \fInumlines\fR is equal to zero, the
header is never displayed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIinterval\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Display the statistics every \fIinterval\fR where \fIinterval\fR is the number
of seconds to sleep between each collection.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Display the number of kernel audit events currently configured.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-T\fR \fBu\fR | \fBd\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Display a time stamp.
.sp

time. See \fBtime\fR(2). Specify \fBd\fR for standard date format. See
\fBdate\fR(1).
.RE

.sp
