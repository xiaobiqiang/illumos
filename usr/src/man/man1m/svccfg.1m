.SH NAME
svccfg \- import, export, and modify service configurations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

\fB/usr/sbin/svccfg\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-s\fR \fIFMRI\fR]

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBsvccfg\fR command manipulates data in the service configuration
repository. \fBsvccfg\fR can be invoked interactively, with an individual
subcommand, or by specifying a command file that contains a series of
subcommands.
.sp
.LP
Changes made to an existing service in the repository typically do not take
effect for that service until the next time the service instance is refreshed.
See the \fBrefresh\fR subcommand on the \fBsvcadm\fR(1M) man page for more
details.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR \fIcommand-file\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n

.RE

.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.LP
Subcommands are divided into the categories specified in the subsections that
follow.
.sp
.LP
All subcommands that accept \fIFMRI\fRs also accept abbreviated or globbed
patterns. Instances and services can be abbreviated by specifying the instance
name, or the trailing portion of the service name. For example, given the
\fIFMRI\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/smtp:sendmail
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
All the following are valid abbreviations:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sendmail
:sendmail
smtp
smtp:sendmail
network/smtp
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
While the following are invalid:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
mail
network
network/smt
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Abbreviated forms of \fIFMRI\fRs are unstable, and should not be used in
scripts or other permanent tools. If a pattern matches more than one instance
or service, an error message is printed and no action is taken.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
If a \fIfile\fR is a service profile, properties, including general/enabled,
that are specified in the file are modified in the SMF repository.
Not-yet-existent properties and property groups will be created. The type of
the pre-existing property \fBgroups\fR will not be changed by the profile.
Existing properties (as distinguished from property groups) \fBcan\fR have
their type changed by the profile. Nonexistent services and instances are
ignored. Services and instances modified by the profile will be refreshed. If
\fB-n\fR is specified, the profile is processed and no changes are applied to
the SMF repository. Any syntax error found will be reported on stderr and an
exit code of \fB1\fR will be returned. See \fBsmf\fR(5) for a description of
service profiles. This command requires privileges to modify properties in the
service and instance. See \fBsmf_security\fR(5) for the privileges required to
modify properties. If \fIfile\fR is not a service profile, the subcommand
fails.

.RS 4n
Dumps a full \fBXML\fR service description for all services, instances, and
their persistent properties in the repository. This does not include transient
properties such as service state, and is suitable for a relocatable repository
backup.
.sp
Without the \fB-a\fR option, property groups containing protected information
(identified by the presence of the \fBread_authorization\fR property\(emsee
\fBsmf_security\fR(5)) will be archived without their property values. When the
\fB-a\fR option is specified, all values will be archived. An error results if
there are insufficient privileges to read these values.

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBexport\fR [\fB-a\fR] \fIservice_FMRI\fR [\fI>file\fR]\fR

.RS 4n
The service description for the specified service and its instances is written
to standard output or redirected to the given file. Dependencies with a boolean
"external" property set to true are omitted in the belief that they were
created on behalf of another service.
.sp
Without the \fB-a\fR option, property groups containing protected information
(identified by the presence of the \fBread_authorization\fR property\(emsee
\fBsmf_security\fR(5)) will be exported without their property values. When the
\fB-a\fR option is specified, all values will be archived. An error results if
there are insufficient privileges to read these values.
.sp
Note that \fBexport\fR requires a service FMRI. To ease the use of arguments
cut and pasted from other command output, if you specify a complete
instance FMRI, the entire corresponding service including all instances
is exported and a warning is issued.  If you specify an abbreviation, such as
\fBapache2\fR or \fBsendmail\fR, that specifies an instance, the command fails.

If \fIfile\fR is a service manifest, then the services and instances it
specifies are imported into the repository. According to the file, dependencies
may be created in other services. See \fBsmf\fR(5) for a description of service
manifests. See \fBsmf_security\fR(5) for the privileges required to create and
modify service configurations.
.sp
Services and instances in the manifest will be validated against template data
in the manifest and the repository, and warnings will be issued for all
template violations. See \fBsmf_template\fR(5) for a description of templates.
If the \fB-V\fR option is specified, manifests that violate the defined
templates will fail to import. In interactive invocations of \fBsvccfg\fR,
\fB-V\fR is the default behavior.
.sp
For existing services and instances, properties which have not changed since
the last \fBimport\fR snapshot was taken are upgraded to those specified by the
manifest. Conflicts (properties which have been changed both in the repository
and the manifest) are reported on the standard error stream. \fBsvccfg\fR will
never upgrade the "general/enabled" and "general/restarter" properties, since
they represent administrator preference.

If \fIfile\fR is determined to be a service manifest, then the \fBFMRI\fRs of

\fB\fBrestore\fR\fR

.RS 4n
Restores the contents of the repository from a full XML service description
previously created by the \fBarchive\fR subcommand. If the archive was
generated without the use of the \fB-a\fR option, the contents of the
repository following completion of the restore will not include the values of
any read-protected properties (see \fBsmf_security\fR(5)). If these are
required, they must be restored manually.
.sp
Restoring an archive which is inconsistent with currently installed software
(including patch revisions) might yield unpredictable results. Therefore, prior
to restoring an archive, all system and application software, including any
service manifests, should be restored to the same state it was in at the time
the archive was made.

\fB\fBvalidate\fR [\fIfile\fR | \fIfmri\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBvalidate\fR subcommand can operate on a manifest file, an instance FMRI,
or the current instance or snapshot entity selection. When an argument is
specified, \fBsvccfg\fR will check to see whether the specified file exists. If
the file exists, it will be validated. If a file of the specified name does not
exist, the argument is treated as an FMRI pattern. If a conflict arises between
a filename and an FMRI, use the \fBsvc:\fR and \fBfile:\fR prefixes to tell
\fBsvccfg\fR how to interpret the argument.
.sp
When you specify a file, the file is processed in a manner similar to
\fBimport\fR \fB-V\fR, but no changes are made to the repository. If any errors
are detected, \fBsvccfg\fR displays the errors and exits with a nonzero exit
status.
.sp
For an instance \fIfmri\fR, instance entity selection, or snapshot entity
selection, the specified instance in its composed form (see "Properties and
Property Groups" in \fBsmf\fR(5)) will be validated against template data in
the repository. Instance FMRIs and instance entity selections use the "running"
snapshot for validation. Warnings will be issued for all template violations.
