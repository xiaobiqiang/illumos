.SH NAME
ipmpstat \- display IPMP subsystem status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBipmpstat\fR [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIfield\fR[,...] [\fB-P\fR]] \fB-a\fR|\fB-g\fR|\fB-i\fR|\fB-p\fR|\fB-t\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBipmpstat\fR command concisely displays information about the IPMP
subsystem. It supports five different output modes, each of which provides a
different view of the IPMP subsystem (address, group, interface, probe, and
target), described below. At most one output mode may be specified per
invocation, and the displayed information is guaranteed to be self-consistent.
It also provides a parsable output format which may be used by scripts to
examine the state of the IPMP subsystem. Only basic privileges are needed to
invoke \fBipmpstat\fR, with the exception of probe mode which requires all
privileges.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:

Display only the specified output fields, in order. The list of field names is
case-insensitive and comma-separated. The field names that are supported depend
on the selected output mode, described below. The special field name \fBall\fR
may be used to display all fields for a given output mode.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

Display IPMP target information ("target" output mode).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-P\fR\fR
.ad

specified, an explicit list of fields must be specified using the \fB-o\fR
option.
.RE

.SH OUTPUT MODES
.LP
The \fBipmpstat\fR utility supports the output modes listed below. Note that
these modes map to some of the options described above.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBAddress Mode\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Address mode displays the state of all IPMP data addresses on the system. The
following output fields are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBADDRESS\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The hostname (or IP address) associated with the information. Note that because
duplicate down addresses may exist, the address must be taken together with the
\fBGROUP\fR to form a unique identity. For a given IPMP group, if duplicate
addresses exist, at most one will be displayed, and an up address will always
take precedence.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The state of the address. Either \fBup\fR if the address is \fBIFF_UP\fR (see
\fBifconfig\fR(1M)), or \fBdown\fR if the address is not \fBIFF_UP\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGROUP\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The IPMP IP interface hosting the address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBINBOUND\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The underlying IP interface that will receive packets for this address. This
may change in response to external events such as IP interface failure. If this
field is empty, then the system will not accept IP packets sent to this address
(for example, because the address is down or because there are no active IP
interfaces left in the IPMP group).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBOUTBOUND\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The underlying IP interfaces that will send packets using this source address.
This may change in response to external events such as IP interface failure. If
this field is empty, then the system will not send packets with this address as
a source (for example, because the address is down or because there are no
active IP interfaces left in the IPMP group).
.RE

If \fB-o\fR is not specified, all output fields are displayed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBGroup Mode\fR

output fields are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBGROUP\fR\fR

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
.LP
By default, \fBipmpstat\fR uses a human-friendly tabular format for its output
modes, where each row contains one or more fields of information about a given
object, which is in turn uniquely identified by one or more of those fields. In
this format, a header identifying the fields is displayed above the table (and
after each screenful of information), fields are separated by whitespace, empty
fields are represented by \fB--\fR (double hyphens), and other visual aids are
used. If the value for a field cannot be determined, its value will be
displayed as "\fB?\fR" and a diagnostic message will be output to standard
error.
.sp
.LP
Machine-parsable format also uses a tabular format, but is designed to be
efficient to programmatically parse. Specifically, machine-parsable format
differs from human-friendly format in the following ways:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
No headers are displayed.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Fields with empty values yield no output, rather than showing \fB--\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Fields are separated by a single colon (\fB:\fR), rather than variable amounts
of whitespace.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
If multiple fields are requested, and a literal \fB:\fR or a backslash
(\fB\e\fR) occur in a field's value, they are escaped by prefixing them with
\fB\e\fR\&.
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES

\fBExample 1 \fRObtaining Failure Detection Time of a Specific Interface
