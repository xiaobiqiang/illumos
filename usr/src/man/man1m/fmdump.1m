.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBfmdump\fR utility can be used to display the contents of any of the log
files associated with the Fault Manager, \fBfmd\fR(1M). The Fault
Manager runs in the background on each system. It receives telemetry
information relating to problems detected by the system software, diagnoses
these problems, and initiates proactive self-healing activities such as
disabling faulty components.
.sp
.LP
The Fault Manager maintains two sets of log files for use by administrators and
service personnel:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBerror log\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
A log which records error telemetry, the symptoms of problems detected by the
system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBfault log\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
A log which records fault diagnosis information, the problems believed to
explain these symptoms.
.RE

.sp
.LP
By default, \fBfmdump\fR displays the contents of the fault log, which records
the result of each diagnosis made by the fault manager or one of its component
modules.
.sp
.LP
An example of a default \fBfmdump\fR display follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# fmdump
TIME                 UUID                                 SUNW-MSG-ID

\&...
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Each problem recorded in the fault log is identified by:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The time of its diagnosis
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) that can be used to uniquely identify this
particular problem across any set of systems
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A message identifier that can be used to access a corresponding knowledge
article located on http://illumos.org/msg/
.RE
.sp
.LP
If a problem requires action by a human administrator or service technician or
affects system behavior, the Fault Manager also issues a human-readable message
to \fBsyslogd\fR(1M). This message provides a summary of the problem and a
reference to the knowledge article on http://illumos.org/msg/.
.sp
.LP
You can use the \fB-v\fR and \fB-V\fR options to expand the display from a
single-line summary to increased levels of detail for each event recorded in
the log. The \fB-c\fR, \fB-t\fR, \fB-T\fR, and \fB-u\fR options can be used to
filter the output by selecting only those events that match the specified
\fIclass\fR, range of times, or \fIuuid\fR.
.sp
.LP
If more than one filter option is present on the command-line, the options
combine to display only those events that are selected by the logical \fBAND\fR
of the options. If more than one instance of the same filter option is present
on the command-line, the like options combine to display any events selected by
the logical \fBOR\fR of the options. For example, the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# fmdump -u uuid1 -u uuid2 -t 02Dec03
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
selects events whose attributes are \fB(uuid1 OR uuid2\fR) \fBAND\fR (time on
or after 02Dec03).
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIclass\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Select events that match the specified class. The class argument can use the
glob pattern matching syntax described in \fBsh\fR(1). The class represents a
hierarchical classification string indicating the type of telemetry event.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display events from the fault management error log instead of the fault log.
This option is shorthand for specifying the pathname of the error log file.
.sp
The error log file contains Private telemetry information. This information is
recorded to facilitate post-mortem analysis of problems and event replay, and
should not be parsed or relied upon for the development of scripts or other
tools.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Follow the growth of the log file by waiting for additional data. \fBfmdump\fR
enters an infinite loop where it will sleep for a second, attempt to read and
format new data from the log file, and then go back to sleep. This loop can be
terminated at any time by sending an interrupt (\fBControl-C\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Print the localized diagnosis message associated with each entry in the fault
log.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR \fIname\fR[.\fIname\fR]*[=\fIvalue\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Select fault log or error log events, depending on the \fB-e\fR option, that
have properties with a matching name (and optionally a matching value). For
string properties the value can be a regular expression match. Regular
expression syntax is described in the EXTENDED REGULAR EXPRESSIONS section of
the \fBregex\fR(5) manual page. Be careful when using the characters:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$  *  {  ^  |  (  )  \e
.fi
.in -2
.sp

\&...or a regular expression, because these are meaningful to the shell. It is
safest to enclose any of these in single quotes. For numeric properties, the
value can be octal, hex, or decimal.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIdir\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6

instead of the default root (\fB/\fR).

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Fault logs contain references to records stored in error logs that can be
displayed using \fBfmdump\fR \fB-V\fR to understand the errors that were used
in the diagnosis of a particular fault. These links are preserved if an error
log is renamed as part of log rotation. They can be broken by removing an error
log file, or by moving it to another filesystem directory. \fBfmdump\fR can not
display error information for such broken links. It continues to display any
and all information present in the fault log.
