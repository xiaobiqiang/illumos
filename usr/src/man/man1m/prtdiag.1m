.SH NAME
prtdiag \- display system diagnostic information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/prtdiag\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-l\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBprtdiag\fR displays system configuration and diagnostic information on
\fBsun4u\fR, \fBsun4v\fR, and x86 systems.
.sp
.LP
The diagnostic information lists any failed field replaceable units
(\fBFRU\fRs) in the system.
.sp
.LP
The interface, output, and location in the directory hierarchy for
\fBprtdiag\fR are uncommitted and subject to change in future releases.
.sp
.LP
\fBprtdiag\fR does not display diagnostic information and environmental status
when executed on the Sun Enterprise 10000 server. See the
\fB/var/opt/SUNWssp/adm/${SUNW_HOSTNAME}/messages\fR file on the system service
processor (SSP) to obtain such information for this server.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp

to \fBsyslogd\fR(1M) only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Verbose mode. Displays the time of the most recent \fBAC\fR Power failure, and
the most recent hardware fatal error information, and (if applicable)
environmental status. The hardware fatal error information is useful to repair
and manufacturing for detailed diagnostics of \fBFRU\fRs.
.RE

Not all diagnostic and system information is available on every Solaris
platform, and therefore cannot be displayed by \fBprtdiag\fR. On those
platforms, further information can be obtained from the System Controller.
