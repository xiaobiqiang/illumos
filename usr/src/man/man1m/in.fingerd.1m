.SH NAME
in.fingerd, fingerd \- remote user information server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/in.fingerd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfingerd\fR implements the server side of the Name/Finger protocol, specified
in \fIRFC 742\fR. The Name/Finger protocol provides a remote interface to
programs which display information on system status and individual users. The
protocol imposes little structure on the format of the exchange between client
and server. The client provides a single command line to the finger server
which returns a printable reply.
.sp
.LP
\fBfingerd\fR waits for connections on \fBTCP\fR port 79. Once connected, it
reads a single command line terminated by RETURN-LINEFEED and passes the
arguments to \fBfinger\fR(1), prepended with \fB-s\fR. \fBfingerd\fR closes its
connections as soon as the output is finished.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Connecting directly to the server from a \fBTIP\fR or an equally narrow-minded
TELNET-protocol user program can result in meaningless attempts at option
negotiation being sent to the server, which foul up the command line
interpretation. \fBfingerd\fR should be taught to filter out \fBIAC\fR's and
perhaps even respond negatively (\fBIAC\fR does not)  to all option commands
received.
.sp
.LP
The \fBin.fingerd\fR service is managed by the service management facility,
\fBsmf\fR(5), under the service identifier:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/finger:default
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or
requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(1M). Responsibility for
initiating and restarting this service is delegated to \fBinetd\fR(1M). Use
\fBinetadm\fR(1M) to make configuration changes and to view configuration
information for this service. The service's status can be queried using the
\fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
