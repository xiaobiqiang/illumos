.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBatohexlabel\fR converts a human readable label into an internal text
representation that is safe for storing in a public object. If no option is
supplied, the label is assumed to be a sensitivity label.
.sp
.LP
Internal conversions can later be parsed to their same value. This internal
form is often hexadecimal. The converted label is written to the standard
output file. If no human readable label is specified, the label is read from
the standard input file. The expected use of this command is emergency repair
of labels that are stored in internal databases.
