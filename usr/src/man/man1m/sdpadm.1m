.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsdpadm\fR command is used to display the system state of the Sockets
Direct Protocol (SDP) protocol. The \fBsdpadm\fR command can optionally be used
to set the state of the SDP protocol. See \fBsdp\fR(7D).

By default the SDP protocol is disabled on the system.  It can be enabled by
using \fBsdpadm\fR \fBenable\fR.
