.In sys/mac_provider.h
.Sh INTERFACE LEVEL
illumos DDI specific
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy mac_callbacks
structure is used by GLDv3 networking device drivers implementing the
.Xr mac 9E
interface.
.Pp
The structure is normally allocated statically by drivers as a single
global entry.
A pointer to it is passed as the
.Sy m_callbacks
member of the
.Sy mac_register_t
structure.
.Sh TYPES
The following types define the function pointers in use in the
.Sy mac_register_t .

.Pp
The
.Sy mc_callbacks
member is used to denote which of a series of optional callbacks are
present.
This method allows additional members to be added to the
.Sy mac_callbacks_t
structure while maintaining ABI compatibility with existing modules.
If a member is not mentioned below, then it is a part of the base version
of the structure and device drivers do not need to set anything to
indicate that it is present.
The
.Sy mc_callbacks
member should be set to the bitwise inclusive OR of the following
pre-processor values:
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent
.It Sy MC_IOCTL
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_ioctl
structure member has been set.
.It Sy MC_GETCAPAB
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_getcapab
structure member has been set.
.It Sy MC_OPEN
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_open
structure member has been set.
.It Sy MC_CLOSE
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_close
structure member has been set.
.It Sy MC_SETPROP
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_setprop
structure member has been set.
.It Sy MC_GETPROP
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_getprop
structure member has been set.
.It Sy MC_PROPINFO
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_propinfo
structure member has been set.
.It Sy MC_PROPERTIES
Indicates that the
.Sy mc_getprop ,
.Sy mc_propinfo ,
and
.Sy mc_setprop
structure members have been set.

.Pp
The
.Sy mc_getstat
function defines an entry point used to receive statistics about the
device.
A list of statistics that it is required to support is available in
.Xr mac 9E .
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_getstat 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_start
member defines an entry point that is used to start the device.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_start 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_stop
member defines an entry point that is used to stop the device.
It is the opposite of the
.Sy mc_start
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_stop 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_setpromisc
member is used to enable and disable promiscuous mode on the device.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_setpromisc 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_multicst
member is used to enable or disable multicast addresses in the device's
filters.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_multicst 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_unicst
member is used to set the primary unicast MAC address of the device.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_unicst 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_tx
member is used to transmit a single message on the wire.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_tx 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_ioctl
member is used to process device specific ioctls.
The GLDv3 does not define any ioctls that devices should handle; however, there
may be private ioctls for this device.
This entry point is optional.
For it to be considered, the
.Sy MC_IOCTL

.Sy mc_callbacks
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_ioctl 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_getcapab
member is used to determine device capabilities.
Each capability has its own data and semantics associated with it.
A list of capabilities is provided in
.Xr mac 9E .
This entry point is optional.
For it to be used, the
.Sy MC_GETCAPAB
value must be present in the
.Sy mc_callbacks
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_getcapab 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_open
member is used to provide specific actions to take when the device is
opened.
Note that most device drivers will not have a need to implement this.
It is not required for this function to be implemented for this device to be
used with
.Xr dlpi 7P .
This entry point is optional.
For it to be used, the
.Sy MC_OPEN
value must be present in the
.Sy mc_callbacks
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_open 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_close
member is used to provide specific actions to take when the device is
closed.
Note that most device drivers will not have a need to implement this.
It is not required for this function to be implemented for this device to be
used with
.Xr dlpi 7P .
This entry point is optional.
For it to be used, the
.Sy MC_CLOSE
value must be present in the
.Sy mc_callbacks
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_close 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_getprop
member is used to get the current value of a property from the device.
A list of properties, their sizes, and their interpretation is available in
.Xr mac 9E .
This entry point is optional.
For it to be used, the
.Sy MC_GETPROP
value must be present in the
.Sy mc_callbacks
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_getprop 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_setprop
member is used to set the value of a device property.
A list of properties, their sizes, and their interpretation is available in
.Xr mac 9E .
This entry point is optional.
For it to be used, the
.Sy MC_SETPROP
value must be present in the
.Sy mc_callbacks
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_setprop 9E .
.Pp
The
.Sy mc_propinfo
member is used to obtain metadata about a property such as its default
value, whether or not it is writable, and more.
A list of properties, their sizes, and their interpretation is available in
.Xr mac 9E .
This entry point is optional.
For it to be used, the
.Sy MC_PROPINFO
value must be present in the
.Sy mc_callbacks
member.
For more information on the requirements of the function, see
.Xr mc_propinfo 9E .
.Ss Required Members
Many members in the structure are optional; however, the following
members must be set or a call to
.Xr mac_register 9F
will fail.
.Bl -bullet -offset indent

.Sy mc_getstat

.Sy mc_start

.Sy mc_setpromisc

.Sy mc_multicst

.Sy mc_tx

.Pp
Note, that devices which implement the GLDv3 ring capabilities must not
implement the
.Sy mc_unicst
and
.Sy mc_tx
functions.
However, the ring capabilities are still private and evolving at this time.
.Pp
Generally, a device that implements one of
.Sy mc_getprop ,
.Sy mc_setprop ,
or
.Sy mc_propinfo
will want to implement all three endpoints to ensure that the property
is fully integrated into user land utilities such as
.Xr dladm 1M .
