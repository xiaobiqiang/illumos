.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_door_info
function injects the
.Xr door_info 3C
library call into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle

have the same meaning as in
.Xr door_info 3C .

for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy door_info
library call and its arguments.

The
.Fn pr_door_info
function only works on active processes.
Process handles that correspond to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects
do not support library call injection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_door_info
function's return value is that described in
.Xr door_info 3C .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the library call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For the full list of errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr door_info 3C .

.Fn pr_door_info
function will fail if:
