.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Paddr_to_ctf ,
.Fn Plmid_to_ctf ,
and
.Fn Pname_to_ctf
functions lookup CTF (Compact C Type Format) data, for use with
.Sy libctf ,
from the process represented by the handle
.Fa P .
In all cases, the CTF sections of both the running executable and its
shared libraries are searched.
.Pp
The CTF container returned is valid as long as the process handle
.Fa P
is valid.
That is, until a call to
.Xr Prelease 3PROC
is made.
Further, consumers must not close the CTF container.
.Pp
The
.Fn Paddr_to_ctf
function attempts to find the CTF section, if any, that exists for the
address
.Fa addr .
Note, not all addresses correspond to memory regions that have CTF
data.
For example, if a user creates a region of anonymous memory through the
.Xr mmap 2
function, then it will not have any corresponding CTF information.
.Pp
The
.Fn Pname_to_ctf
function looks up the object named
.Fa name
and returns the corresponding CTF section, if any exists.
Two special values may be used for name.
The macro
.Dv PR_OBJ_EXEC
refers to the executable object itself and the macro
.Dv PR_OBJ_LDSO refers to the object ld.so.1 .
.Pp
The
.Fn Plmid_to_ctf
function is similar to
.Fn Pname_to_ctf .
It allows the passing of a link-map identifier,
.Fa lmid ,
which constricts the search of the object named with
.Fa name
to that link-map.
The special value of
.Dv PR_LMID_EVERY
indicates that every link-map should be searched, which is equivalent
in behavior to the
.Fn Pname_to_ctf
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Paddr_to_ctf ,
.Fn Plmid_to_ctf ,
and
.Fn Pname_to_ctf
functions return a pointer to the corresponding CTF container.
Otherwise, if none exists then
.Dv NULL
is returned.
