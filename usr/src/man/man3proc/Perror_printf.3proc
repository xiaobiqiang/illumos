.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Perror_printf
function allows for consumers of the
.Sy libproc
library to obtain additional diagnostic information during various
operations.
Consumers must explicitly
.Em interpose
on this symbol and provide their own definition, if desired.
There is no requirement for such an interposition to be done.
When called,
.Fa P
will be the process handle that the additional diagnostics are being
generated for and the diagnostics will be provided in a
.Xr printf 3C
style.
.Sh INTERFACE STABILITY
.Sy Uncommitted
.Pp
While the interposing interface is
.Sy uncommitted ,
the provided diagnostics are
.Sy Not-an-Interface
and may change at any time.
.Sh LOCKING
Callers should presume that this function may be called from multiple
threads and always in a context in which taking locks is fine.
Callers should not expect to be called from a signal handler.
