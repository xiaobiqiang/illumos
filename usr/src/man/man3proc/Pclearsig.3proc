.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libproc.h

.Sh DESCRIPTION
During normal operation a process may receive a signal.
Signals may indicate an error, for example referencing unmapped memory, an alarm
firing, requests for information, and users requesting an interruption.
For more information on the generation and usage of signals, see
.Xr signal.h 3HEAD .
.Pp
The
.Fn Pclearsig
function instructs the system to clear any signal pending delivery to
a thread in the process represented by the process handle
.Fa P .
The pending signal will never be delivered to process represented by
.Fa P .
.Pp
The
.Fn Lclearsig
function is identical to the
.Fn Pclearsig
function, except rather than operating on the process and its
representive thread, it instead operates on the thread handle
.Fa L .
.Pp
The
.Fn Pclearsig
function only has meaning for active processes.
It will fail on process handles corresponding to core files, zombie processes
and ELF objects.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pclearsig
function clears pending faults and
returns
.Sy 0 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned,
.Sy errno
is set to indicate the error,
and no faults are cleared.
.Sh ERRORS
For a full list of possible errors see the
.Sy DIAGNOSTICS
