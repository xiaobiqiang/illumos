.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Pgcore
and
.Fn Pfgcore
functions produce core files of the handle referred to by
.Fa P .
Core files represent a snapshot of a process and may be manipulated by a
wide variety of tools and libraries including
.Xr libproc 3LIB ,
.Xr mdb 1 ,
.Xr pargs 1 ,
.Xr pstack 1 ,
and more.
For details on the core file format, see
.Xr core 4 .
.Pp
.Fn Pfgcore
writes the core to the file represented by the open descriptor
.Fa fd .
The file descriptor should be open for both read and write.
.Fn Pgcore
writes the core to the file path
.Fa fname .
.Pp
The content of the core is controlled by the
.Fa content
argument.
It's the inclusive-bitwise-OR of the various content types listed under the
.Sy core_content_t
heading in the
.Sy TYPES
section in
.Xr libproc 3LIB .
Using
.Dv CC_CONTENT_INVALID
is illegal and will result in an error.
.Pp
Neither the
.Fn Pgcore
or
.Fn Pfgcore
functions stop the handle
.Fa P .
It is up to the caller to stop the process; which is recommended for
obtaining a consistent view of the process.
See the
.Xr Pstop 3PROC
function for a means to stop a handle.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pfcore
and
.Fn Pgcore
functions return
.Sy 0
and write out a core file to specified location.
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned.
The
.Fn Pfgcore
function will truncate
.Fa fd
and the
.Fn Pgcore
function will remove
.Fa fname .

.Sy Uncommitted

.Sy LOCKING
