.Sh NAME
.Nm Plwp_getspymaster

.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libproc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo Plwp_getspymaster
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "lwpid_t lwpid"
.Fa "psinfo_t *ps"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Plwp_getspymaster
function returns information about the spy master that corresponds to
the agent LWP for the thread
.Fa lwpid
in the process handle
.Fa P .
.Pp
The agent LWP allows another process to inject actions into the target process.
When an agent LWP is created, it leverages an existing thread in the process and
it also creates a record of whom created the agent, which is called the spy
master.
For more information on the agent LWP and the spy master, see
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
If the thread identified
.Fa lwpid
has an agent LWP, the corresponding ps information
.Po see
.Xr proc 4
for the definition of the
.Sy psinfo_t
.Pc
will be filled into
.Fa ps .
.Pp
Note, process handles that correspond to a file, created by
.Xr Pgrab_file 3PROC ,
cannot have an agent LWP created for them and thus cannot have any spy
master information.
In addition, core files from older releases may not have any data on the spy
master.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Plwp_getspymaster
returns
.Sy 0
and updates
.Fa ps .
Otherwise, it returns
.Sy -1 ,
sets
.Sy errno ,
and
.Fa ps
is not modified.
