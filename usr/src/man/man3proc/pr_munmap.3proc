.Sh NAME
.Nm pr_munmap
.Nd inject munmap system call into victim process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libproc
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo pr_munmap
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "void *addr"
.Fa "size_t len"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_munmap
function injects the
.Xr munmap 2
system call into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle
.Fa P
is the value
.Dv NULL
then this will be equivalent to calling
.Xr munmap 2
on the currently running process.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa addr
and
.Fa len
have the same meaning as in
.Xr munmap 2 .
See
.Xr munmap 2
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy munmap
system call and its arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_munmap
function only works on active processes.
Process handles that correspond to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects
do not support system call injection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_munmap
function's return value is that described in
.Xr munmap 2 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the system call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For the full list of errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr munmap 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_munmap
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOSYS
An error occurred while trying to invoke the agent LWP and inject a
system call in the process handle
.Fa P
or the process handle
.Fa P
does not support system call injection.
