.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm Pdelbkpt
.Nd clear a breakpoint in a process
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libproc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo Pdelbkpt
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "uintptr_t address"
.Fa "ulong_t saved"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Pdelbkpt
function removes the breakpoint installed at
.Fa address
from process
.Fa P .
Restoring the instruction present in
.Fa saved .
.Pp
If the instruction at
.Fa address
is no longer the architecture-specific breakpoint instruction, then
.Fa saved
is not restored, but the function still returns successfully.
This behavior is done due to the presence of setting breakpoints in
self-modifying code, e.g. procedure linkage tables.
.Pp
The
.Fn Pdelbkpt
function only works on running processes, such as those created through
.Xr Pgrab 3PROC
and
.Xr Pcreate 3PROC .
Attempting to remove a breakpoint from process handles to core files,
zombie processes, or ELF objects will fail.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pdelbkpt
function removes the breakpoint and
returns
.Sy 0 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned, and
.Sy errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
For a full list of possible errors see the
.Sy DIAGNOSTICS
section in
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
The
.Fn Pdelbkpt
function will fail with:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOENT
The handle
.Fa P
refers to a grabbed core file, a zombie process, or an ELF object.
