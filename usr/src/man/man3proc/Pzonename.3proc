.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Pzonename
function attempts to determine the name of the zone for the process
handle
.Fa P .
If found, up to
.Fa nbytes ,
including a null terminator, will be written into
.Fa buf .
.Pp
The
.Fn Pzoneroot
function attempts to determine the root of the zone corresponding to the
process handle
.Fa P .
If found, up to
.Fa nbytes ,
including a null terminator, will be written into
.Fa buf .
If the root cannot be found, for example a core file that did not
originate on the current system, then the empty string will be written
into
.Fa buf .
.Pp
The
.Fn Pzonepath
function attempts to derive the full path of the object
.Fa path
in a zone relative to the root associated with the current process
handle
.Fa P .
If found, up to
.Fa nbytes ,
including a null terminator, will be written into
.Fa buf .
It is legal to use the same buffer for both
.Fa path
and
.Fa buf ;
it will not be updated unless the function completes successfully.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pzonename ,
.Fn Pzoneroot ,
and
.Fn Pzonepath
functions return
.Sy buf .
Otherwise, if an error occurred,
.Dv NULL
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn Pzonename
and
.Fn Pzoneroot
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENODATA
.Fa P
refers to a core file and zone information was not available in the core
dump or
.Fa P
refers to an ELF object grabbed through
.Xr Pgrab_file 3PROC .
.It Er EFAULT
.Fa P
refers to an active process and
.Fa buf
is invalid.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn Pzoneroot
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory was available on the system.
