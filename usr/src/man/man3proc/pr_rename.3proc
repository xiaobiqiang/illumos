.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_rename
function injects the
.Xr rename 2
system call into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle
.Fa P
is the value
.Dv NULL
then this will be equivalent to calling
.Xr rename 2
on the currently running process.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa old
and
.Fa new
have the same meaning as in
.Xr rename 2 .
See
.Xr rename 2
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy rename
system call and its arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_rename
function only works on active processes.
Process handles that correspond to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects
do not support system call injection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_rename
function's return value is that described in
.Xr rename 2 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the system call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For the full list of errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr rename 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_rename
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
