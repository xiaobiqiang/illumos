.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn proc_arg_grab
and
.Fn proc_arg_xgrab
functions are utility functions which process arguments pointing to a
currently active process or a core file and returns a process handle to
it.
.Pp
The string
.Fa arg
contains the name of something to try and open.
How it is interpreted depends on the value of
.Fa oflag .
The following values may be passed in as a bitwise-exclusive-OR for
.Fa oflag :
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent
.It Dv PR_ARG_PIDS
Allows
.Fa arg
to specify process IDs and /proc arguments.
.It Dv PR_ARG_CORES
Allows
.Fa arg
to specify core files.
.It PR_ARG_ANY
Encompasses all of the previous opens.
.El
.Pp
The argument
.Fa gflag
controls the behavior when the corresponding process grabbing function
is called by the underlying system.
For a list of flags that may be passed in here, see
.Xr Pgrab 3PROC
and
.Xr Pgrab_core 3PROC .
.Pp
The argument
.Fa perr
must be a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
pointer and in the event that the
.Fn proc_arg_grab
or
.Fn proc_arg_xgrab
functions fail, then
.Fa perr
will be updated with a more detailed error number.
.Pp
The
.Fa path
argument allows a search path for its binaries to be specified in case a
core file is found and opened.
.Pp
If the
.Fa lwps
argument is
.Pf non- Dv NULL ,
then if there is a thread specification present in
.Fa arg ,
it will be validated to see if it is a valid range and then a pointer to
the start of the thread specification will be stored in
.Fa lwps .
For more information on determining process range validity, see
.Xr proc_lwp_range_valid 3PROC
for more information on valid and invalid tread specifications.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn proc_arg_grab
and
.Fn proc_arg_xgrab
functions return a pointer to the process handle is returned.
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and
.Fa perr
is set to include a more specific error.
.Sh ERRORS
For a full list of additional errors, see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr Pgrab 3PROC
and
.Xr Pgrab_core 3PROC .
.Pp
The
.Fn proc_arg_grab
and
.Fn proc_arg_xgrab
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er G_BADLWPS
.Fa arg
contains an invalid thread specification.
.It Er G_NOCORE
.Dv PR_ARG_CORES
was set and no core file could be found corresponding to
.Fa arg .
.It Er G_NOPROC
.Dv PR_ARG_PIDS
was set and no process could be found corresponding to
.Fa arg .
.It Er G_NOPROCORCORE
Both
.Dv PR_ARG_CORES
and
.Dv PR_ARG_NOPROC
were set and no process or core file could be found corresponding to
.Fa arg .
