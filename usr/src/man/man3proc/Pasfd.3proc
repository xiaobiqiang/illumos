.Sh NAME
.Nm Pasfd
.Nd obtain the process address space file descriptor
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libproc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo Pasfd
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Pasfd
funtion returns a file descriptor that allows direct access to the
address space of the process handle
.Fa P .
A defined file descriptor is provided when using the
.Xr Pcreate 3PROC ,
.Xr Pgrab 3PROC ,
.Xr Pgrab_file 3PROC ,
and
.Xr Pgrab_core 3PROC
functions.
Note that the address space may be different in each of these cases and doesn't
necessarily correspond to the /proc
.Sy as
file, except for live processes.
Other means of obtaining a
.Sy libproc
process handle may not define a file descriptor that contains the
address space.
.Pp
The returned file descriptor must not be closed and is only valid for
as long as the corresponding process handle
.Fa P
is valid.
After a call to
.Xr Prelease 3PROC
the file descriptor is invalidated.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pasfd
function returns a valid file descriptor.
Otherwise, if none exists, then
.Sy -1
is returned.
