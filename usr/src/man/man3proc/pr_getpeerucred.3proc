.Sh NAME
.Nm pr_getpeerucred
.Nd inject getpeerucred library call into victim process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libproc
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo pr_getpeerucred
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "int fd"
.Fa "ucred_t **ucp"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_getpeerucred
function injects the
.Xr getpeerucred 3C
library call into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle
.Fa P
is
.Dv NULL
then this is equivalent to calling
.Xr getpeerucred 3C
on the currently running process.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa fd
and
.Fa *ucp
have the same meaning as in
.Xr getpeerucred 3C .
See
.Xr getpeerucred 3C
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy getpeerucred
library call and its arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_getpeerucred
function only works on active processes.
Process handles that correspond to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects
do not support library call injection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_getpeerucred
function's return value is that described in
.Xr getpeerucred 3C .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the library call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For a full list of possible errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr getpeerucred 3C .
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_getpeerucred
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOSYS
An error occurred while trying to invoke the agent LWP and inject a
library call in the process handle
.Fa P
or the process handle
.Fa P
does not support library call injection.
