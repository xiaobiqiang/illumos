.Sh NAME
.Nm Psetsignal
.Nd set signal tracing flags
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libproc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libproc.h
.Ft void
.Fo Psetsignal
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "const sigset_t *set"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Psetsignal
function sets the signal tracing flags for the process handle
.Fa P
to
.Fa set .
The call to
.Fn Psetsignal
replaces any existing signal tracing flags entirely with
.Fa set .
The signal tracing flags determine which signals, when received by a
thread in the process, will cause that thread to stop.
For more information on the behavior of the signal tracing flags, including
which signals may be traced this way, see the
.Sy PCSTRACE
section in
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
The
.Fa set
argument may be manipulated with the standard signal set manipulation
functions such as
.Xr sigaddset 3C ,
.Xr sigdelset 3C ,
and others which may all be found in
.Xr sigsetops 3C .
.Pp
Note, only active processes may have their signal tracing flags updated.
Process handles that refer to core files, zombie processes, and files do
not have fault tracing flags and this function is a no-op on them.
