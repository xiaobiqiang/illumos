.Sh NAME
.Nm Pclearfault ,
.Nm Lclearfault
.Nd clear process and thread faults
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libproc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo Pclearfault
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo Lclearfault
.Fa "struct ps_lwphandle *L"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
During normal operation a process may encounter a
.Sy fault ,
due to a hardware exception, identifying a problem with the running process.
Hardware faults include things like executing illegal instructions, encountering
a breakpoint, and arithmetic exceptions.
Faults are discussed further in
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
The
.Fn Pclearfault
function instructs the system to clear any fault pending delivery to a
thread in the process represented by the process handle
.Fa P .
The pending fault will never be delivered to process represented by
.Fa P .
.Pp
The
.Fn Lclearfault
function is identical to the
.Fn Pclearfault
function, except rather than operating on the representative thread of
the process it operates on the thread handle
.Fa L .
.Pp
The
.Fn Pclearfault
and
.Fn Lclearfault
functions only have meaning for active processes.
They will fail on process handles corresponding to zombie processes, ELF
objects, and cores.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pclearfault
and
.Fn Lclearfault
functions clear pending faults and return
.Sy 0 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned,
.Sy errno
is set to indicate the error,
and no faults are cleared.
.Sh ERRORS
For a full list of possible errors see the
.Sy DIAGNOSTICS
section in
