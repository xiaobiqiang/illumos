.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Psync
function synchronizes modifications to the process handle
.Fa P
back to the underlying active process.
The
.Fn Psync
function ensures that any outstanding process holds, register
modifications, signal injections, and modifications to the various fault
and system call tracing flags are taken care of.
.Pp
Normally this function is not required as other library routines take
care of synchronizing this state out to the process when it is required.
If the underlying /proc file system routines are used outside of the
library, calling this function may be required.
.Pp
The
.Fn Psync
function is only meaningful for active processes.
It will do nothing on process handles that refer to core files, zombie
processes, and ELF objects.
.Pp
The
.Fn Lsync
function is equivalent to the
.Fn Psync
function, except rather than operating on the entire process and its
representative thread, it instead operates on the thread handle
.Fa L .
