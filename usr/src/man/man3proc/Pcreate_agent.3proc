.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Pcreate_agent
function creates the agent LWP in the process represented by the handle
.Fa P .
The agent LWP is used as a means to force system calls to be invoked on
the controlled process.
For more information on the agent LWP, see
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
The agent LWP cannot be created for process handles corresponding to
core files, zombie processes, processes that have yet to run, and ELF
objects.
.Pp
The
.Fn Pcreate_agent
function is reentrant.
It may be entered recursively.
The act of creating the agent LWP will cause the process to be stopped.
For every call to the
.Fn Pcreate_agent
function, a corresponding call to
.Xr Pdestroy_agent 3PROC
is required.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pcreate_agent
function returns
.Sy 0
and creates the agent LWP.
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned,
.Sy errno
is set to indicate the error, and the agent LWP is not created.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn Pcreate_agent
function will fail if:
