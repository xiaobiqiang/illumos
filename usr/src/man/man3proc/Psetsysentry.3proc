.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Psetsysentry
and
.Fn Psetsysexit
set the system call entry and exit tracing flags respectively in the
process handle
.Fa P
to
.Fa set .
The call to
.Fn Psetsysentry
or
.Fn Psetsysexit
replaces the corresponding set of system call tracing flags entirely
with the new set.
The system call entry tracing flags cause a thread to stop on entry to the
system call and the exit tracing flags cause a thread to stop on return from the
system call, before control returns back to the user land process.
For more information on the state of the thread and for information on
manipulating the
.Sy sysset_t ,
see
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
Note that only active processes may have their system call tracing flags
updated.
Process handles that refer to core files, zombie processes, and files do not
have fault tracing flags and this function is a no-op on them.
