.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Ft int
.Fo Preopen
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Preopen
function is used to regain control of the process represented by the
handle
.Fa P .
A loss of control is indicated by the
.Xr Pstatus 3PROC
function returning the value
.Dv PS_LOST .
This may occur when the controlled process performs an
.Xr exec 2
of a setuid or setgid binary or one where the controlling process cannot
read the object file.
For more information on this, see the
.Sy PROGRAMMING NOTES
section of
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
If successful, the controlling process will obtain control of the
process specified by
.Fa P .
If it fails, the controlling process should release the handle with
.Xr Prelease 3PROC .
Note there are occasions where due to permissions it may not be possible
to obtain control again.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Preopen
function returns
.Sy 0.
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned.
