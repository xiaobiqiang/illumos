.Sh NAME
.Nm pr_getpeername
.Nd inject getpeername library call into victim process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libproc
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo pr_getpeername
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "int sock"
.Fa "struct sockaddr *name"
.Fa "socklen_t *namelen"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_getpeername
function injects the
.Xr getpeername 3SOCKET
library call into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle
.Fa P
is
.Dv NULL
then this is equivalent to calling
.Xr getpeername 3SOCKET
on the currently running process.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa sock ,
.Fa name ,
and
.Fa namelen
have the same meaning as in
.Xr getpeername 3SOCKET .
See
.Xr getpeername 3SOCKET
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy getpeername
library call and its arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_getpeername
function only works on active processes.
Process handles that correspond to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects
do not support library call injection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_getpeername
function's return value is that described in
.Xr getpeername 3SOCKET .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the library call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For the full list of errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr getpeername 3SOCKET .
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_getpeername
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOSYS
An error occurred while trying to invoke the agent LWP and inject a
library call in the process handle
.Fa P
or the process handle
.Fa P
does not support library call injection.
