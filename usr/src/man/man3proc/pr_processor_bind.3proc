.Sh NAME
.Nm pr_processor_bind
.Nd inject processor_bind system call into victim process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libproc
.In libproc.h
.Ft int
.Fo pr_processor_bind
.Fa "struct ps_prochandle *P"
.Fa "idtype_t idtype"
.Fa "id_t id"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_processor_bind
function injects the
.Xr processor_bind 2
system call into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle
.Fa P
is the value
.Dv NULL
then this will be equivalent to calling
.Xr processor_bind 2
on the currently running process.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa idtype ,
.Fa id ,
.Fa processorid ,
and
.Fa obind
have the same meaning as in
.Xr processor_bind 2 .
See
.Xr processor_bind 2
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy processor_bind
system call and its arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_processor_bind
function only works on active processes.
Process handles that correspond to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects
do not support system call injection.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_processor_bind
function's return value is that described in
.Xr processor_bind 2 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the system call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For the full list of errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr processor_bind 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_processor_bind
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOSYS
An error occurred while trying to invoke the agent LWP and inject a
system call in the process handle
.Fa P
or the process handle
.Fa P
does not support system call injection.
