.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Plwp_getregs ,
.Fn Plwp_setregs ,
.Fn Plwp_getfpregs ,
and
.Fn Plwp_setfpregs
functions allow one to get and set the general purpose and floating
point registers from the thread
.Fa lwpid
in the process handle
.Fa P .
.Pp
The
.Fn Plwp_getfpregs
function updates the structure pointed to by
.Fa fpregs
with the state and values of the floating point registers of the thread
specified by
.Fa lwpid .
.Pp
The
.Fn Plwp_setfpregs
function updates the floating point registers of the thread specified by
.Fa lwpid
to the register state contained in
.Fa fpregs .
.Pp
The
.Fn Plwp_getregs
function updates the structure pointed to by
.Fa gregs
with the state and values of the general purpose registers of the thread
specified by
.Fa lwpid.
.Pp
The
.Fn Plwp_setregs
function updates the general purpose registers of the thread specified
by
.Fa lwpid
to the register state contained in
.Fa gregs .
.Pp
Processes must be stopped before obtaining the register state of
individual threads.
Processes may be stopped with
.Xr Pstop 3PROC .
The structures used for registers are described in
.Xr proc 4
and their defintions may be found in
.In sys/regset.h .
The definitions of these structures varies based on the architecture of
the system and the running process.
.Pp
One may not set the register values of a process that is not an active
process, e.g. a process handle that refers to a file or a core file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Plwp_getregs ,
.Fn Plwp_setregs ,
.Fn Plwp_getfpregs ,
and
.Fn Plwp_setfpregs
functions return
.Sy 0
and obtain or set the register state.
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned,
.Sy errno
is set to indicate the error, and the register state is not updated nor
are the data pointers changed.
.Sh ERRORS
For a full list of possible errors also see the
.Sy DIAGNOSTICS
section in
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
The
.Fn Plwp_getregs ,
.Fn Plwp_setregs ,
.Fn Plwp_getfpregs ,
and
.Fn Plwp_setfpregs
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er EBUSY
The process handle
.Fa P
is not currently stopped.
.It Er ENOENT
There is no thread in
.Fa P
with id
.Fa lwpid .
