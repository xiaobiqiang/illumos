.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Pobjname
and
.Fn Pobjname_resolved
functions attempt to determine the underlying mapped object that
contains the virtual address
.Fa addr
in the process handle
.Fa P .
.Pp
A program consists of multiple memory mappings.
Some are provided by the system, such as the stack and the heap.
While others are created through explicit calls to
.Xr mmap 2
or brought in by the run-time link-editor due to dependencies
specified in binaries and libraries.
.Pp
If
.Fa addr
is contained in a mapping, then up to
.Fa bufsize
characters, including the null terminator,
of the name of the corresponding object will be written into
.Fa buffer .
The
.Fn Pobjname_resolved
function attempts to resolve the object to a full file system path.
If the full file-system path cannot be determined, then it will fall back
to the name that the run-time link-editor has for that mapping, which is
the behavior of
.Fn Pobjname .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn Pobjname
and
.Fn Pobjname_resolved
functions return
.Fa buffer .
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned to indicate the object name could not be found.
