.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pr_stat ,
.Fn pr_lstat ,
and
.Fn pr_fast
functions inject the
.Xr stat 2 ,
.Xr lstat 2 ,
and
.Xr fstat 2
system calls respectively into the target process
.Fa P
by means of the agent LWP.
If the process handle
.Fa P
is the value
.Dv NULL
then this will be equivalent to calling
.Xr stat 2 ,
.Xr lstat 2 ,
or
.Xr fstat 2
on the currently running process.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa path ,
and
.Fa buf
to the
.Fn pr_stat
function have the same meaning as in
.Xr stat 2 .
See
.Xr stat 2
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy stat
system call and its arguments.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa fd ,
and
.Fa buf
to the
.Fn pr_fstat
function have the same meaning as in
.Xr fstat 2 ,
see
.Xr fstat 2
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy fstat
system call and its arguments.
.Pp
The arguments
.Fa path ,
and
.Fa buf
to the
.Fn pr_lstat
function have the same meaning as in
.Xr lstat 2 ,
see
.Xr lstat 2
for the full description and purpose of the
.Sy lstat
system call and its arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_stat ,
.Fn pr_lstat ,
and
.Fn pr_fstat
functions only work on active processes.
Process handles that correspond to core files, zombie processes, or ELF objects
do not support system call injection.
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_stat64 ,
.Fn pr_fstat64 ,
and
.Fn pr_lstat64
functions are equivalent to
.Fn pr_stat ,
.Fn pr_fstat ,
and
.Fn pr_lstat
respectively; however, rather than having the stat information be subject to the
data model of the target process, they always provide 64-bit stat information.
See
.Xr lf64 5
for more information.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pr_stat
function's return value is that described in
.Xr stat 2 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Sy errno
is set to
.Er ENOSYS
to indicate that the system call could not be injected.
.Sh ERRORS
For the full list of errors see the
.Sy ERRORS
section in
.Xr stat 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pr_stat
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er ENOSYS
An error occurred while trying to invoke the agent LWP and inject a
system call in the process handle
.Fa P
or the process handle
.Fa P
does not support system call injection.
