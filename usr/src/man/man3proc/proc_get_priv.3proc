.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn proc_get_priv
function is a convenient way to read the /proc privilege file for the
process
.Fa pid .
The
.Fn proc_get_priv
function takes care of allocating memory for the privilege set and
ensures that it is large enough to hold all of the privilege sets.
The definition of the
.Sy prpriv_t
structure may be found in
.Xr proc 4 .
.Pp
The
.Fn proc_free_priv
function releases the memory that was allocated by a call to
.Fn proc_get_priv .
It is safe to pass the
.Dv NULL
pointer in as
.Fa prp ,
the function will simply return without taking any action in that case.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn proc_get_priv
function returns a pointer to an allocated
.Sy prpriv_t
with the privileges of
.Fa pid .
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned to indicate an error occurred.
