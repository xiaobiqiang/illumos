.TH GETPEERNAME 3XNET "Jun 10, 2002"
.SH NAME
getpeername \- get the name of the peer socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcc\fR [ \fIflag\fR ... ] \fIfile\fR ... \fB-lxnet\fR [ \fIlibrary\fR ... ]
#include <sys/socket.h>

\fBint\fR \fBgetpeername\fR(\fBint\fR \fIsocket\fR, \fBstruct sockaddr *restrict\fR \fIaddress\fR,
     \fBsocklen_t *restrict\fR \fIaddress_len\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBgetpeername()\fR function retrieves the peer address of the specified
socket, stores this address in the \fBsockaddr\fR structure pointed to by the
\fIaddress\fR argument, and stores the length of this address in the object
pointed to by the \fIaddress_len\fR argument.
.sp
.LP
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied
\fBsockaddr\fR structure, the stored address will be truncated.
.sp
.LP
If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer is not
bound, then the value stored in the object pointed to by \fIaddress\fR is
unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned.  Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned and
\fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
