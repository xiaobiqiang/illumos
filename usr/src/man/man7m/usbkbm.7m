.SH NAME
usbkbm \- keyboard STREAMS module for Sun USB Keyboard
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB\fR

open("/dev/kbd", O_RDWR)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBusbkbm\fR \fBSTREAMS\fR module processes byte streams generated by a
keyboard attached to a \fBUSB\fR port.  \fBUSB\fR keyboard is a member of
Human Interface Device (HID) Class, and \fBusbkbm\fR only supports the keyboard
protocol defined in the specification.  Definitions for altering keyboard
translation and reading events from the keyboard are in \fB<sys/kbio.h>\fR and
\fB<sys/kbd.h>\fR\&.
.sp
.LP
The \fBusbkbm\fR \fBSTREAMS\fR module adheres to the interfaces exported by
\fBkb\fR(7M). Refer to the \fBDESCRIPTION\fR section of \fBkb\fR(7M) for a
discussion of the keyboard translation modes and the \fBIOCTL\fR section for
the supported \fBioctl\fR(2) requests.
.SS "IOCTLS"
.LP
\fBUSB\fR Keyboard \fBusbkbm\fR returns different values for the following
ioctls than \fBkb\fR(7M):
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBKIOCTYPE\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 13n
This \fBioctl()\fR returns a new keyboard type defined for the \fBUSB\fR
keyboard. All types are listed below:
.RE

.sp
.in +2
.nf
KB_SUN3   Sun Type 3 keyboard
KB_SUN4   Sun Type 4 keyboard
KB_ASCII  ASCII terminal masquerading as keyboard
KB_PC     Type 101 PC keyboard
KB_USB    USB keyboard
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBUSB\fR keyboard type is \fBKB_USB\fR; \fBusbkbm\fR will return
\fBKB_USB\fR in response to the \fBKIOCTYPE\fR ioctl.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBKIOCLAYOUT\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
The argument is a pointer to an \fBint\fR. The layout code specified by the
\fBbCountryCode\fR value returned in the \fBHID\fR descriptor is returned in
the int pointed to by the argument. The \fBcountrycodes\fR are defined in 6.2.1
of the \fBHID\fR 1.0 specifications.

.RS 15n
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBKBD_CMD_CLICK/KBD_CMD_NOCLICK\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBkb\fR(7M) indicates that inappropriate commands for particular keyboards
are ignored. Because clicking is not supported on the \fBUSB\fR keyboard,
\fBusbkbm\fR ignores this command
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBKBD_CMD_SETLED\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Set keyboard LEDs. Same as \fBkb\fR(7M).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBKBD_CMD_GETLAYOUT\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The country codes defined in 6.2.1 of the \fBHID\fR 1.0 specification are
returned.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBKBD_CMD_BELL/KBD_CMD_NOBELL\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
This command is supported although the \fBUSB\fR keyboard does not have a
buzzer.  The request for the bell is rerouted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBKBD_CMD_RESET\fR \fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
There is no notion of resetting the keyboard as there is for the type4
keyboard. \fBusbkbm\fR ignores this command and does not return an error.
