Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
.SH PARAMETERS

\fBnet_phylookup\fR(9F).

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_phygetnext()\fR function searches through all of the network
interfaces that a network protocol "owns". To start searching through all of
the interfaces owned by a protocol, a value of 0 should be passed through as
the value of \fBifp\fR. When 0 is returned by this function, the last of the
interfaces owned by this protocol has been reached.
.sp
.LP
When called successfully, the value returned represents a network interface
that exists, at the time of the call, within the scope of the network
interface. This value is only guaranteed to be unique for a name within the
scope of the network protocol.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   net_data_t net;
    phy_if_t ifp;
    char buffer[32];

    net = net_protocol_lookup("inet");

    if (net != NULL) {
         for (ifp = net_phygetnext(net, 0); ifp != 0;
              ifp = net_phygetnext(net, ifp)) {
              /* Do something with ifp */
              if (net_getifname(net, ifp, buffer,
                   sizeof(buffer) >= 0)
                    printf("Interface %s0, buffer);
          }
      }
.fi

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_phygetnext()\fR function returns -1 if it is not supported by the
network  protocol or 0 if an attempt to go beyond the last network  interface
is  made. Otherwise, it returns  a  value representing a network interface.
.SH CONTEXT
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_phygetnext()\fR function may be called from user,  kernel, or
interrupt context.
