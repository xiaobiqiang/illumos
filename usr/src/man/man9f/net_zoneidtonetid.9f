valid \fBzoneid_t\fR structure that refers to a running zone.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBnet_zoneidtonetid()\fR function maps the given \fBzoneid_t\fR structure
(used to represent a zone that is currently running) into a \fBnetid_t\fR
structure that is associated with the \fBIP\fR instance supporting network
functions for that zone.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
The \fBnet_zoneidtonetid()\fR function returns -1 if no mapping took place.
Otherwise, it returns the \fBnetid_t\fR structure currently used by the
\fBzoneid_t\fR structure. For zones that are using a shared \fBIP\fR instance,
the \fBnetid_t\fR structure for the instance owned by the global zone is
returned.
.SH CONTEXT
.LP
The \fBnet_zoneidtonetid()\fR function may be called from user,  kernel, or
interrupt context.
