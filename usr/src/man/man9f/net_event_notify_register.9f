.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_event_notify_register()\fR function registers a function represented
by the pointer \fIcallback\fR to be called when there is a change to the event
represented by \fIfamily\fR. The types of changes for which notifications are
available for is currently limited to the addition and removal of hooks.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnet_event_notify_unregister()\fR function indicates that there is no
longer any desire to receive notification of changes to the event through
function calls to the specified \fIcallback\fR.
.sp
.LP
The name of a hook should be considered a private interface unless otherwise
specified. The hook names used by \fBIPFilter\fR in Solaris are a public, but
uncommitted, interface.
.sp
.LP
Multiple \fIcallback\fR functions may be registered through this interface. The
same set of parameters is passed to each \fIcallback\fR function. The memory
referenced through the pointers passed to  the  \fIcallback\fR should be
treated as pointing to read-only memory. Changing this data is strictly
prohibited.
.sp
.LP
The function that is called when the \fIevent\fR occurs must not block any
other events.
.sp
.LP
The arguments passed through to the \fBcallback\fR are as follows (the command
is either \fBHN_REGISTER\fR or \fBHN_UNREGISTER\fR):
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname1\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
is the name of the protocol.

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname2\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
is the name of the event
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname3\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
is the name of the hook being added/removed

.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If these functions succeed, 0 is returned. Otherwise, the following error is
returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBEEXIST\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
the given callback function is already registered.

.SH CONTEXT
