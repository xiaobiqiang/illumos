.TH T_GETPROTADDR 3NSL "May 7, 1998"
.SH NAME
t_getprotaddr \- get the protocol addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>

\fBint\fR \fBt_getprotaddr\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_bind *\fR\fIboundaddr\fR,
     \fBstruct t_bind *\fR\fIpeeraddr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the
\fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these
interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When
using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the
\fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR
\fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two
interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_getprotaddr()\fR function returns local and remote protocol addresses
currently associated with the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR. In
\fIboundaddr\fR and \fIpeeraddr\fR the user specifies \fImaxlen\fR, which is
the maximum size (in bytes) of the address buffer, and \fIbuf\fR which points
to the buffer where the address is to be placed. On return, the \fIbuf\fR field
of \fIboundaddr\fR points to the address, if any, currently bound to \fIfd\fR,
and the \fIlen\fR field specifies the length of the address. If the transport
endpoint is in the \fBT_UNBND\fR state, zero is returned in the \fIlen\fR field
of \fIboundaddr\fR. The \fIbuf\fR field of \fIpeeraddr\fR points to the
address, if any, currently connected to \fIfd\fR, and the \fIlen\fR field
specifies the length of the address. If the transport endpoint is not in the
\fBT_DATAXFER,\fR \fBT_INREL,\fR \fBT_OUTCON\fR or  \fBT_OUTREL\fR states, zero
is returned in the \fIlen\fR field of \fIpeeraddr\fR. If the  \fImaxlen\fR
field of  \fIboundaddr\fR or \fIpeeraddr\fR is set to zero, no address is
returned.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a
value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
ALL - apart from \fBT_UNINIT\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTBUFOVFLW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The number of bytes allocated for an incoming argument (\fImaxlen)\fR is
greater than  \fB0\fR but not sufficient to store the value of that argument.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI
and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error
\fB(t_errno)\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
.RE

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY

defined.
