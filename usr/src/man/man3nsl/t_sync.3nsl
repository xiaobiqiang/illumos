.SH NAME
t_sync \- synchronize transport library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_sync\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the
\fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these
interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When
using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the
\fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR
\fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two
interfaces.
.sp
.LP
For the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR, \fBt_sync()\fR synchronizes
the data structures managed by the transport library with information from the
underlying transport provider. In doing so, it can convert an uninitialized
file descriptor (obtained by means of a  \fBopen\fR(2), \fBdup\fR(2) or as a
result of a \fBfork\fR(2) and \fBexec\fR(2)) to an initialized transport
endpoint, assuming that the file descriptor referenced a transport  endpoint,
by updating and allocating the necessary library data structures. This function
also allows two cooperating processes to synchronize their interaction with a
transport provider.
.sp
.LP
For example, if a process forks a new process and issues an \fBexec\fR(2), the
new process must issue a \fBt_sync()\fR to build the private library data
structure associated with a transport endpoint and to synchronize the data
structure with the relevant provider information.
.sp
.LP
It is important to remember that the transport provider treats all users of a
transport endpoint as a single user. If multiple processes are using the same
endpoint, they should coordinate their activities so as not to violate the
state of the transport endpoint.  The function \fBt_sync()\fR returns the
current state of the transport endpoint to the user, thereby enabling the user
to verify the state before taking further action. This coordination is only
valid among cooperating processes; it is possible that a process or an incoming
event could change the endpoint's state \fIafter\fR a \fBt_sync()\fR is issued.
.sp
.LP
If the transport endpoint is undergoing a state transition when \fBt_sync()\fR
is called, the function will fail.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
On successful completion, the state of the transport endpoint is returned.
Otherwise, a value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an
error. The state returned is one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBT_UNBND\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Unbound.

.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint. This
error may be returned when the \fIfd\fR has been previously closed or an
erroneous number may have been passed to the call.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI
and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error
\fB(t_errno)\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTSTATECHNG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
The transport endpoint is undergoing a state change.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
.RE

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use
different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two
interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces
should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
#include <tiuser.h>
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot
be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.br
.in +2
\fBTPROTO\fR
.in -2
