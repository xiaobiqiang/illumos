.TH T_GETSTATE 3NSL "May 7, 1998"
.SH NAME
t_getstate \- get the current state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_getstate\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the
\fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these
interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When
using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the
\fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR
\fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two
interfaces.
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_getstate()\fR function returns the current state of the provider
associated with the transport endpoint specified by \fIfd\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
State is returned upon successful completion.  Otherwise, a value of  -1 is
returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.  The current state is
one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBT_UNBND\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Unbound.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBT_INCON\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Incoming connection pending.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBT_DATAXFER\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Data transfer.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If the provider is undergoing a state transition when \fBt_getstate()\fR is
called, the function will fail.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI
and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error
\fB(t_errno)\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTSTATECHNG\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
The transport provider is undergoing a transient state change.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
.RE

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use
different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two
interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces
should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
#include <tiuser.h>
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR value that can be set by the \fBXTI\fR interface and cannot
be set by the \fBTLI\fR interface is:
.sp
.LP
\fBTPROTO\fR
