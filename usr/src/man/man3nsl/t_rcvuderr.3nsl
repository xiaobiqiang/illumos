.TH T_RCVUDERR 3NSL "May 7, 1998"
.SH NAME
t_rcvuderr \- receive a unit data error indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <xti.h>



\fBint\fR \fBt_rcvuderr\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBstruct t_uderr *\fR\fIuderr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This routine is part of the \fBXTI\fR interfaces which evolved from the
\fBTLI\fR interfaces. \fBXTI\fR represents the future evolution of these
interfaces. However, \fBTLI\fR interfaces are supported for compatibility. When
using a \fBTLI\fR routine that has the same name as an \fBXTI\fR routine, the
\fBtiuser.h\fR header file must be used.  Refer to the  \fBTLI\fR
\fBCOMPATIBILITY\fR section for a description of differences between the two
interfaces.
.sp
.LP
This function is used in connectionless-mode to receive information concerning
an error on a previously sent data unit, and should only be issued following a
unit data error indication. It informs the transport user that a data unit with
a specific destination address and protocol options produced an error. The
argument \fIfd\fR identifies the local transport endpoint through which the
error report will be received, and \fIuderr\fR points to a \fBt_uderr\fR
structure containing the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
struct netbuf addr;
struct netbuf opt;
t_scalar_t error;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fImaxlen\fR field of \fIaddr\fR and \fIopt\fR must be set before calling
this function to indicate the maximum size of the buffer for each. If this
field is set to zero for  \fIaddr\fR or  \fIopt\fR, no information is returned
in the  \fIbuf\fR field of this parameter.
.sp
.LP
On return from this call, the \fIaddr\fR structure specifies the destination
protocol address of the erroneous data unit, the \fIopt\fR structure identifies
options that were associated with the data unit, and \fBerror\fR specifies a
protocol-dependent error code.
.sp
.LP
If the user does not care to identify the data unit that produced an error,
\fIuderr\fR may be set to a null pointer, and \fBt_rcvuderr()\fR will simply
clear the error indication without reporting any information to the user.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of  \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, a
value of  -1 is returned and \fBt_errno\fR is set to indicate an error.
.SH VALID STATES
.sp
.LP
\fBT_IDLE\fR.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
On failure, \fBt_errno\fR is set to one of the following:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTBADF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTBUFOVFLW\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
The number of bytes allocated for the incoming protocol address or options
\fI(maxlen)\fR is greater than 0 but not sufficient to store the information.
The unit data error information to be returned in \fIuderr\fR will be
discarded.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTNOTSUPPORT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
This function is not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTNOUDERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
No unit data error indication currently exists on the specified transport
endpoint.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTOUTSTATE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
The communications endpoint referenced by \fIfd\fR is not in one of the states
in which a call to this function is valid.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTPROTO\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI
and the transport provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error
\fB(t_errno)\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBTSYSERR\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
.RE

.SH TLI COMPATIBILITY
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR and \fBTLI\fR interface definitions have common names but use
different header files. This, and other semantic differences between the two
interfaces are described in the subsections below.
.SS "Interface Header"
.sp
.LP
The \fBXTI\fR interfaces use the header file, \fBxti.h\fR. \fBTLI\fR interfaces
should \fInot\fR use this header.  They should use the header:
.br
.in +2
\fB#include <tiuser.h>\fR
.in -2
.SS "Error Description Values"
.sp
.LP
The \fBt_errno\fR values \fBTPROTO\fR and \fBTOUTSTATE\fR can be set by the
\fBXTI\fR interface but not by the \fBTLI\fR interface.
.sp
.LP
A \fBt_errno\fR value that this routine can return under different
circumstances than its \fBXTI\fR counterpart is \fBTBUFOVFLW.\fR It can be
returned even when the \fBmaxlen\fR field of the corresponding buffer has been
set to zero.
.SS "Option Buffers"
.sp
.LP
The format of the options in an \fBopt\fR buffer is dictated by the transport
provider. Unlike the \fBXTI\fR interface, the \fBTLI\fR interface does not fix
the buffer format.
