.SH NAME
filesystem \- File system organization
.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The file system tree is organized for administrative convenience. Distinct
areas within the file system tree are provided for files that are private to
one machine, files that can be shared by multiple machines of a common
platform, files that can be shared by all machines, and home directories. This
organization allows sharable files to be stored on one machine but accessed by
many machines using a remote file access mechanism such as \fBNFS\fR. Grouping
together similar files makes the file system tree easier to upgrade and manage.
.sp
.LP
The file system tree consists of a root file system and a collection of
mountable file systems. The \fBmount\fR(2) program attaches mountable file
systems to the file system tree at mount points (directory entries) in the root
file system or other previously mounted file systems. Two file systems, \fB/\fR
(the root) and \fB/usr\fR, must be mounted and \fB/var\fR must be accessible to
have a functional system. The root file system is mounted automatically by the
kernel at boot time; the \fB/usr\fR file system is mounted by the system
start-up script, which is run as part of the booting process. \fB/var\fR can be
mounted as its own file system or be part of \fB/usr\fR, as it is by default.
.sp
.LP
Certain locations, noted below, are approved installation locations for bundled
Foundation Solaris software. In some cases, the approved locations for bundled
software are also approved locations for add-on system software or for
applications. The following descriptions make clear where the two locations
differ. For example, \fB/etc\fR is the installation location for
platform-dependent configuration files that are bundled with Solaris software.
The analogous location for applications is \fB/etc/opt/\fR\fIpackagename\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the following descriptions, \fIsubsystem\fR is a category of application or
system software, such as a window system (\fBdt\fR) or a language
(\fBjava1.2\fR)
.sp
.LP
The following descriptions make use of the terms \fBplatform\fR,
\fBplatform-dependent\fR, \fBplatform-independent\fR, and
\fBplatform-specific\fR. Platform refers to a machines Instruction Set
Architecture or processor type, such as is returned by \fBuname\fR \fB-i\fR.
\fBPlatform-dependent\fR refers to a file that is installed on all platforms
and whose contents vary depending on the platform. Like a platform-dependent
file, a \fBplatform-independent\fR file is installed on all platforms. However,
the contents of the latter type remains the same on all platforms. An example
of a platform-dependent file is compiled, executable program. An example of a
platform-independent file is a standard configuration file, such as
\fB/etc/hosts\fR. Unlike a platform-dependent or a platform-independent file,
the \fBplatform-specific\fR file is installed only on a subset of supported
platforms. Most platform-specific files are gathered under \fB/platform\fR and
\fB/usr/platform\fR.

.SS "\fB/usr\fR File System"
.LP
Because it is desirable to keep the root file system small and not volatile, on
disk-based systems larger file systems are often mounted on \fB/home\fR,
\fB/opt\fR, \fB/usr\fR, and \fB/var\fR.
.sp
.LP
The file system mounted on \fB/usr\fR contains platform-dependent and
platform-independent sharable files. The subtree rooted at \fB/usr/share\fR
contains platform-independent sharable files; the rest of the \fB/usr\fR tree
contains platform-dependent files. By mounting a common remote file system, a
group of machines with a common platform may share a single \fB/usr\fR file
system. A single \fB/usr/share\fR file system can be shared by machines of any
platform. A machine acting as a file server can share many different \fB/usr\fR
file systems to support several different architectures and operating system
releases. Clients usually mount \fB/usr\fR read-only so that they do not
accidentally change any shared files.
