.Sh NAME
.Nm eventfd
.Nd Linux-compatible user event notification facility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/eventfd.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Linux-borne facility for sending and receiving user
events via a file descriptor.
While the facility itself is somewhat dubious (it can be mimicked in an entirely
portable way with a pipe), it is small and straightforward and this
implementation is entirely compatible with its Linux antecedent; see
.Xr eventfd 3C
for details.
