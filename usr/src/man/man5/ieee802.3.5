.Sh NAME
.Nm ieee802.3
.Nd IEEE 802.3 Ethernet parameters and statistics
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The IEEE 802.3 standard specifies the details for Ethernet
networking.
This page describes the various statistics and tunables that device drivers
supporting Ethernet commonly offer.
.
Note that not every device or driver supports every one of these
values, and many devices offer additional statistics and tunables that
are specific to that hardware.
See the device driver's documentation for those specific details.
.
.Lp
Values that are statistics are visible
.Xr kstat 1M ,
whereas properties are visible using the
.Xr dladm 1M
.Sy show-linkprop
subcommand.
Tunables are properties that can be changed using the
.Xr dladm 1M
.Sy set-linkprop
subcommand.
A more useful summary of current operational state can be seen with the
.Xr dladm 1M
.Sy show-ether
subcommand.
.
.Ss Statistics
The following statistics are accessible with
.Xr kstat 1M .
Note that some statistics are available in both 32- and 64-bit counters,
in which case the name of the 64 bit statistic will be the same as the
32-bit, but with
.Dq Sy 64
appended.
For example,
.Sy ipackets64
is the 64-bit version of the
.Sy ipackets
statistic.
These are indicated with the special suffix
.Op Sy 64
in the table below.

.El
.Ss Auto-negotiation
With modern devices, auto-negotiation is normally handled automatically.
With 10 Gbps and 1000 Gbps, it is mandatory (10GBASE-T also requires full-duplex
operation).
It is also
.Em strongly
recommended for use whenever possible; without auto-negotiation the link
will usually not operate unless both partners are configured to use the
same link mode.
.Lp
Auto-negotiation, when enabled, takes place by comparing the local capabilities
that have been advertised (which must also be supported by the local device),
with the capabilities that have been advertised by the link partner (peer).
.
The first of the following modes that is supported by both partners is
selected as the link negotiation result:
.Lp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
10 Gbps (10gfdx)
.It
1000 Mbps full-duplex (1000fdx)
.It
1000 Mbps half-duplex (1000hdx)
.It
100 Mbps full-duplex (100fdx)
.It
100BASE-T4 (100T4)
.It
100 Mbps half-duplex (100hdx)
.It
10 Mbps full-duplex (10fdx)
.It
10 Mbps half-duplex (10hdx)
.El
.Lp
Advertisement of these modes can be enabled or disabled by setting the
appropriate
.Sy en_
property in
.Xr dladm 1M .
.Lp
Auto-negotiation may also be disabled, by setting the
.Sy adv_autoneg_cap
property to 0.
In this case, the highest enabled link mode (using the above list) is
.Dq forced
for the link.
.Ss Flow Control
Link layer flow control is available on many modern devices, and is mandatory
for operation at 10 Gbps.
It requires that the link be auto-negotiated, and that the link be full-duplex,
in order to function.
.Lp
Flow control is applied when a receiver becomes congested.
In this case the receiver can send a special frame, called a pause frame, to
request its partner cease transmitting for a short period of time.
.Lp
Flow control can be said to be either symmetric, in which case both partners
can send and honor pause frames, or asymmetric, in which case one partner
may not transmit pause frames.
.Lp
The flow control mode used is driven by the
.Sy flowctrl
property.
It has the following meanings:
.Lp
.Bl -column -compact -offset indent Dv
.It \(dqno\(dq Ta Neither send, nor honor pause frames.
.It \(dqtx\(dq Ta Send pause frames, provided that the peer can support them,
but do not honor them.
.It \(dqrx\(dq Ta Receive and honor pause frames.
.It \(dqbi\(dq Ta Both send and receive (and honor) pause frames.
.El
.Lp
The statistics for flow control
.Po Sy adv_cap_pause , adv_cap_asmpause , lp_cap_pause , lp_cap_asmpause ,
.Sy link_pause ,
and
.Sy link_asmpause
.Pc
are based on the properties exchanged in the auto-negotiation and are
confusing as a result.
Administrators are advised to use the
.Sy flowctrl
property instead.
.
.Ss Jumbo Frames
The IEEE 802.3 standard specifies a standard frame size of 1518 bytes,
which includes a 4-byte frame checksum, a 14-byte header, and 1500 bytes
of payload.
Most devices support larger frame sizes than this, and when all possible parties
on the same local network can do so, it may be advantageous to choose a larger
frame size; 9000 bytes is the most common option, as it allows a transport layer
to convey 8 KB (8192) of data, while leaving room for various link, network, and
transport layer headers.
.Lp
Note that the use of frames carrying more than 1500 bytes of payload is
not standardized, even though it is common practice.
.Lp
The
.Sy mtu
property is used to configure the frame size.
Note that this is the size of the payload, and excludes the preamble, checksum,
and header.
It also excludes the tag for devices that support tagging (see
.Sx Virtual LANs
below).
.Lp
Care must be taken to ensure that all communication parties agree on the same
size, or communication may cease to function properly.
.Lp
Note that the
.Sy mtu
property refers to the link layer property.
It may be necessary to configure upper layer protocols such as IP to use a
different size when this changes.
See
.Xr ifconfig 1M .
.
.Ss Virtual LANs
Most devices support virtual LANs (and also priority control tagging) though
the use of a 4-byte tag inserted between the frame header and payload.
The details of configuration of this are covered in the
.Xr dladm 1M
manual.
.
.Ss Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) Details
.
The correct method for applications to access Ethernet devices directly
is to use the DLPI.
See
.Xr dlpi 7P
and
.Xr libdlpi 3LIB
for further information.
.Lp
The following DLPI parameters are presented to applications.
.Bl -column -offset indent "Broadcast address"
.It Maximum SDU Ta 1500 (or larger, as determined by the Sy mtu No property.)
.It Minimum SDU Ta 0
.It Address length Ta 6
.It MAC type Ta Dv DL_ETHER
.It SAP length Ta \(mi2
.It Service mode Ta Dv DL_CLDLS
.It Broadcast address Ta Li ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff No (6 bytes with all bits set)
.El
.Lp
Note that if the application binds to SAP of 0, then standard IEEE 802.3
mode is assumed and the frame length is stored in place of the Ethernet type.
Frames that arrive with the type field set to 1500 or less, are delivered
to applications that bind to SAP 0.
.Lp
Ethernet drivers on the support both DLPI style 1 and style 2 operation.
Additionally, it is possible to configure provide
.Dq vanity
names to interfaces using the
.Xr dladm 1M
.Sy rename-link
subcommand.
Such vanity names are only accessible using DLPI style 1.
.Sh NOTES
There may be other mechanisms available to configure link layer properties.
Historically the
.Xr ndd 1M
command, and
.Xr driver.conf 4
files could be used to do this.
These methods are deprecated in favor of
.Xr dladm 1M
properties.
.
.Sh INTERFACE STABILITY
When present, the statistics and properties presented here
are
.Sy Committed .
However, note that not every Ethernet device supports all of these,
and some devices may support additional statistics and properties.
.Lp
The DLPI and IEEE 802.3 itself are
.Sy Standard .
