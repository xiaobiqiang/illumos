.TH PAM_RHOSTS_AUTH 5 "Oct 28, 1996"
.SH NAME
pam_rhosts_auth \- authentication management PAM module using ruserok()
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so.1\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The rhosts  \fBPAM\fR module,  \fB/usr/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so.1\fR,
authenticates a user via the \fBrlogin\fR authentication protocol. Only
\fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR is implemented within this module.
\fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR uses the \fBruserok\fR(3SOCKET) library function to
authenticate the \fBrlogin\fR or \fBrsh\fR user. \fBpam_sm_setcred()\fR is a
null function.
.sp
.LP
\fB/usr/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so.1\fR is designed to be stacked on top
of  the \fB/usr/lib/security/pam_unix.so.1\fR module for both the \fBrlogin\fR
and \fBrsh\fR services. This module is normally configured as \fIsufficient\fR
so that subsequent authentication is performed only on failure of
\fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR. The following option may be passed in to this
service module:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdebug\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 10n
\fBsyslog\fR(3C) debugging information at  \fBLOG_DEBUG\fR level.
