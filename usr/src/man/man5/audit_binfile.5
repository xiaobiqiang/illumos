.SH NAME
audit_binfile \- generation of audit logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/security/audit_binfile.so\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBaudit_binfile\fR plugin module for audit,
\fB/usr/lib/security/audit_binfile.so\fR, writes binary audit data to files as
specified in the plugin's attributes configured by \fBauditconfig\fR(1M); it
is the default plugin for the audit daemon \fBauditd\fR(1M). Its output is
described by \fBaudit.log\fR(4).
.SH OBJECT ATTRIBUTES
.LP
The \fBp_dir\fR attribute specifies a comma-separated list of
directories to be used for storing audit files.
.sp
.LP
The \fBp_minfree\fR attribute specifies the percentage of free space required.
If free space falls below this threshold, the audit daemon \fBauditd\fR(1M)
invokes the shell script \fBaudit_warn\fR(1M). The default threshold is 0%.
.sp
.LP
The \fBp_fsize\fR attribute defines the maximum size in bytes that an audit
file can become before it is automatically closed and a new audit file opened.
This is equivalent to an administrator issuing an \fBaudit\fR \fB-n\fR command
when the audit file contains the specified number of bytes. The default size is
zero (0), which allows the file to grow without bound. The value specified must
be within the range of [512,000, 2,147,483,647].
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following commands cause \fBaudit_binfile.so\fR to be activated, specify the
directories for writing audit logs, and specify the percentage of required free
space per directory. Note that using \fBauditconfig\fR(1M) only allows one
attribute to be set at a time.
