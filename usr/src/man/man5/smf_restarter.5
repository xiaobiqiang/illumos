.TH SMF_RESTARTER 5 "May 23, 2008"
.SH NAME
smf_restarter \- service management facility conventions for restarters
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
All service instances in the service management facility must be managed by a
restarter. This manual page describes configuration, functionality, and
reporting characteristics that are common to all restarters in the framework.
Characteristics specific to a particular restarter are described in the
restarter's man page.
.sp
.LP
For each managed service, a restarter relies on retrieving properties on the
service instance to determine configuration. The restarter manages a set of
property groups to communicate the current disposition of a service with
display tools such as \fBsvcs\fR(1).
.SS "Service Configuration"
.sp
.LP
The common restarter configuration for all services is captured in the
\fBgeneral\fR property group. This group includes the following required and
optional property settings.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBenabled\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
This is a required property. If set, the restarter of an instance attempts to
maintain availability of the service.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBrestarter\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
This is an optional property that allows the specification of an alternate
restarter to manage the service instance. If the restarter property is empty or
absent, the restarter defaults to \fBsvc.startd\fR(1M).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsingle_instance\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
This is an optional property. When set, only one instance of the service is
allowed to transition to an online or degraded status at any time.
.RE

.SS "Service Reporting"
.sp
.LP
All restarters report status using the \fBrestarter\fR property group, which
includes the following properties:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBnext_state\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
The current state and next state, if currently in transition, for instances
stored in these properties. See \fBsmf\fR(5) for a description of the potential
states.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBauxiliary_state\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
An astring with no spaces that contains a precise term to describe the full
restarter-specific state in combination with the restarter state property. The
auxiliary state cannot always be set and is always cleared during transition
out of any state. Each restarter must define the precise list of auxiliary
states it uses.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBstate_timestamp\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
The time when the current state was reached.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBcontract\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
The primary process contract ID, if any, under which the service instance is
executing.
