.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Trusted Extensions software is a specific configuration
of the Operating System. Trusted Extensions
provides labels for local objects and processes,
for zones and file systems, and for network
communications. These labels are used to implement a Multilevel Security (MLS)
policy that restricts the flow of information based on label relationships. In
contrast to Discretionary Access Control (DAC) based on ownership, the MLS
policy enforced by Trusted Extensions is an example of Mandatory Access Control
(MAC).

By default, Trusted Extensions software is disabled. It is enabled and disabled
