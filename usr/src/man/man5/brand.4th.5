.Nm brand.4th
.Nd loader ASCII art boot module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file that goes by the name of
.Nm
is a set of commands designed to draw the ASCII art illumos brand above the
boot loader menu.
The commands of
.Nm
by themselves are not enough for most uses.
Please refer to the
examples below for the most common situations, and to
.Xr loader 5
for additional commands.
.Pp
Before using any of the commands provided in
.Nm ,
it must be included
through the command:
.Pp
.Dl include brand.4th
.Pp
This line is present in the default
.Pa /boot/forth/menu.rc
file, so it is not needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.
.Pp
The commands provided by it are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -compact -offset indent
.It Ic draw-brand
Draws the illumos brand.
.Pp
The brand that is drawn is configured by setting the
.Ic loader_brand
variable in
.Xr loader.conf 4
to one of
.Dq Li illumos
(the default) or
.Dq Li none .
.Pp
The position of the logo can be configured by setting the
.Ic loader_brand_x
and
.Ic loader_brand_y
variables in
.Xr loader.conf 4 .
The default values are 2 (x) and 1 (y).

(default) or
