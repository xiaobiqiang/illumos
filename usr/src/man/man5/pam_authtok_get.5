.TH PAM_AUTHTOK_GET 5 "April 9, 2016"
.SH NAME
pam_authtok_get \- authentication and password management module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBpam_authtok_get.so.1\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBpam_authtok_get\fR service module provides password prompting
functionality to the PAM stack. It implements \fBpam_sm_authenticate()\fR and
\fBpam_sm_chauthtok()\fR, providing functionality to both the Authentication
Stack and the Password Management Stack.
.SS "Authentication Service"
.LP
The implementation of \fBpam_sm_authenticate\fR(3PAM) prompts the user name if
not set and then tries to get the authentication token from the pam handle. If
the token is not set, it then prompts the user for a password and stores it in
the \fBPAM\fR item \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR. This module is meant to be the first
module on an authentication stack where users are to authenticate using a
keyboard.
.SS "Password Management Service"
.LP
Due to the nature of the PAM Password Management stack traversal mechanism, the
\fBpam_sm_chauthtok\fR(3PAM) function is called twice. Once with the
\fBPAM_PRELIM_CHECK\fR flag, and one with the \fBPAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK\fR flag.
.sp
.LP
In the first (\fBPRELIM\fR) invocation, the implementation of
\fBpam_sm_chauthtok\fR(3PAM) moves the contents of the \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR
(current authentication token) to \fBPAM_OLDAUTHTOK\fR, and subsequently
prompts the user for a new password. This new password is stored in
\fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR.
.sp
.LP
If a previous module has set \fBPAM_OLDAUTHTOK\fR prior to the invocation of
pam_authtok_get, this module turns into a \fBNO-OP\fR and immediately returns
\fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR.
.sp
.LP
In the second (\fBUPDATE\fR) invocation, the user is prompted to Re-enter his
password. The pam_sm_chauthtok implementation verifies this reentered password
with the password stored in \fBPAM_AUTHTOK\fR. If the passwords match, the
module returns \fBPAM_SUCCESS\fR.
.sp
