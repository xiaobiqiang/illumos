.Nd loader ASCII art boot module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file that goes by the name of
.Nm
is a set of commands designed to draw the ASCII art FreeBSD mascot
\(en known simply as
.Em beastie
\(en to the right of the boot loader menu.
In illumos based systems, the distribution specific logo is used.
The commands of
.Nm
by themselves are not enough for most uses.
Please refer to the
examples below for the most common situations, and to
.Xr loader 5
for additional commands.
.Pp
Before using any of the commands provided in
.Nm ,
it must be included
through the command:
.Pp
.Dl include beastie.4th
.Pp
This line is present in the default
.Pa /boot/loader.rc
file, so it is not needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.
.Pp
The commands provided by it are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -compact -offset indent
.It Ic draw-beastie
Draws the logo.

The logo that is drawn is configured by setting the
.Ic loader_logo
variable in
.Xr loader.conf 4 .
.Pp
The position of the logo can be configured by setting the
.Ic loader_logo_x
and
.Ic loader_logo_y
variables in
.Xr loader.conf 4 .
The default values are 46 (x) and 4 (y).
.Pp
.It Ic clear-beastie
Clears the screen of beastie.
.Pp
.It Ic beastie-start
Initializes the interactive boot loader menu.
.Pp

.Ic loader_delay
variable can be configured in
.Xr loader.conf 4

During the delay the user can press Ctrl-C to fall back to
.Ic autoboot
or ENTER to proceed.
The default behavior is to not delay.
