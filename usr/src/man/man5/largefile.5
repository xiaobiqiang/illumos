.SH NAME
largefile \- large file status of utilities
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A \fIlarge file\fR is a regular file whose size is greater than or equal to 2
Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes). A \fIsmall file\fR is a regular file whose size is less
than 2 Gbyte.
.SS "Large file aware utilities"
.LP
A utility is called \fIlarge file aware\fR if it can process large files in the
same manner as it does small files. A utility that is large file aware is able
to handle large files as input and generate as output large files that are
being processed. The exception is where additional files  are used as system
configuration files or support files that can augment the processing. For
example, the \fBfile\fR utility supports the \fB-m\fR option for an alternative
"magic" file and the \fB-f\fR option for a support file that can contain a list
of file names. It is unspecified whether a utility that is large file aware
will accept configuration or support files that are large files. If a large
file aware utility does not accept configuration or support files that are
large files, it will cause no data loss or corruption upon encountering such
files and will return an appropriate error.
.LP
The following \fB/usr/bin\fR utilities are large file aware:
