.SH NAME
hal \- overview of hardware abstraction layer
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides a view of the various hardware
attached to a system. This view is updated dynamically as hardware
configuration changes by means of hotplug or other mechanisms. HAL represents a
piece of hardware as a device object. A device object is identified by a unique
identifier and carries a set of key/value pairs, referred to as device
properties. Some properties are derived from the actual hardware, some are
merged from device information files (\fB\&.fdi\fR files), and some are related
to the actual device configuration.

.LP
HAL provides an easy-to-use API through D-Bus. D-Bus is an IPC framework that,
among other features, provides a system-wide message-bus that allows
applications to talk to one another. Specifically, D-Bus provides asynchronous
notification such that HAL can notify other peers on the message-bus when
devices are added and removed, as well as when properties on a device are
changing.

.LP
In the Solaris operating system, HAL is supported by a daemon, \fBhald\fR(1M),
and a set of utilities that enable the adding and removing of devices and the
modification of their properties.
