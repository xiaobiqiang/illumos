.SH NAME
audit_class \- audit class definitions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/audit_class\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fB/etc/security/audit_class\fR is a user-configurable ASCII system file that
stores class definitions used in the audit system. Audit events in
\fBaudit_event\fR(4) are mapped to one or more of the defined audit classes.
\fBaudit_event\fR can be updated in conjunction with changes to
\fBaudit_class\fR.
Programs can use the \fBgetauclassent\fR(3BSM) routines to access audit
class information.
.sp
.LP
The fields for each class entry are separated by colons. Each class entry is a
bitmap and is separated from each other by a newline.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBaudit_class\fR file has the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fImask\fR:\fIname\fR:\fIdescription\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp

The fields are defined as follows:

class description
.RE

.sp
.LP
Each class is represented as a bit in the class mask which is an unsigned
integer. Thus, there are 32 different classes available. Meta-classes can also
be defined. These are supersets composed of multiple base classes, and thus
will have more than 1 bit in its mask. See Examples. Two special meta-classes
are also pre-defined: \fBall\fR, and \fBno\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBall\fR\fR

.RS 7n
Represents a conjunction of all allowed classes, and is provided as a shorthand
method of specifying all classes.

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBno\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
Is the invalid class, and any event mapped solely to this class will not be
audited. Turning auditing on to the \fBall\fR meta class will not cause events
mapped solely to the \fBno\fR class to be written to the audit trail. This
class is also used to map obsolete events which are no longer generated.
Obsolete events are retained to process old audit trails files.

.SH NOTES
.LP
It is possible to deliberately turn on the \fBno\fR class in the kernel, in
which case the audit trail will be flooded with records for the audit event
\fBAUE_NULL\fR.
