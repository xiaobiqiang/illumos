.TH NETID 4 "Feb 25, 2017"
.SH NAME
netid \- netname database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/netid\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBnetid\fR file is a local source of information on mappings between
netnames (see \fBsecure_rpc\fR(3NSL)) and user ids or hostnames in the local
domain. The \fBnetid\fR file can be used in conjunction with, or instead of,
a network nameservice. The \fBpublickey\fR entry in
the \fBnsswitch.conf\fR (see \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4)) file determines which of
these sources will be queried by the system to translate netnames to local user
ids or hostnames.
.sp
.LP
Each entry in the \fBnetid\fR file is a single line of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fInetname uid\fR\fB:\fR\fIgid, gid, gid\|.\|.\|.\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
or
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fInetname\fR \fB      0:\fR\fBhostname\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The first entry associates a local user id with a netname. The second entry
associates a hostname with a netname.
.sp
.LP
The  \fBnetid\fR file field descriptions are as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fInetname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The operating system independent network name for the user or host.
\fInetname\fR has one of two formats. The format used to specify a host is of
the form:
.sp
\fBunix.\fR\fBhostname\fR\fB@\fR\fIdomain\fR
.sp
where \fBhostname\fR is the name of the host and \fIdomain\fR is the network
domain name.
.sp
The format used to specify a user id is of the form:
.sp
\fBunix.\fR\fIuid\fR\fB@\fR\fIdomain\fR
.sp
where \fIuid\fR is the numerical id of the user and \fIdomain\fR is the network
domain name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIuid\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The numerical id of the user (see \fBpasswd\fR(4)). When specifying a host
name, \fIuid\fR is always zero.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIgroup\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The numerical id of the group the user belongs to (see \fBgroup\fR(4)).
Several groups, separated by commas, may be listed for a single \fIuid\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBhostname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 12n
The local hostname (see \fBhosts\fR(4)).
.RE

.sp
.LP
Blank lines are ignored. Any part of a line to the right of a `\fB#\fR' symbol
is treated as a comment.
