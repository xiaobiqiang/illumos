.SH NAME
smb \- configuration properties for Solaris CIFS server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Behavior of the Solaris CIFS server is defined by property values that are
stored in the Service Management Facility, \fBsmf\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
An authorized user can use the \fBsharectl\fR(1M) command to set global values
for these properties in SMF.
.sp
.LP
The following list describes the properties:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBads_site\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the site configured in DNS to look up Active Directory information.
Sites provide a mechanism to partition or delegate administration and policy
management, which are typically used in large or complex domains.
.sp
The value should not be set if you do not have a local Active Directory site.
By default, no value is set.
.RE

.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBautohome_map\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the full path for the SMD autohome map file, \fBsmbautohome\fR. The
default path is \fB/etc\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdisposition\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A value that controls whether to disconnect the share or proceed if the map
command fails. The disposition property only has meaning when the map property
has been set. Otherwise it will have no effect.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
disposition = [ continue | terminate ]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBcontinue\fR\fR

exec'd as described below:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%U\fR\fR

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na

.RS 4n
The client hostname, or \fB""\fR if not available.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%L\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The server NetBIOS name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%m\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The client NetBIOS name, or \fB""\fR if not available. This option is only
valid for NetBIOS connections (port 139).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%I\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The IP address of the client machine.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%i\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The local IP address to which the client is connected.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%S\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The name of the share.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%P\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The root directory of the share.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmax_protocol\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the maximum SMB protocol level that the SMB service
should allow clients to negotiate.  The default value is \fB2.1\fR.
Valid settings include: \fB1\fR, \fB2.1\fR, \fB3.0\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmax_workers\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the maximum number of worker threads that will be launched to process
incoming CIFS requests. The SMB \fBmax_mpx\fR value, which indicates to a
client the maximum number of outstanding SMB requests that it may have pending
on the server, is derived from the \fBmax_workers\fR value. To ensure
compatibility with older versions of Windows the lower 8-bits of \fBmax_mpx\fR
must not be zero. If the lower byte of \fBmax_workers\fR is zero, \fB64\fR is
added to the value. Thus the minimum value is \fB64\fR and the default value,
which appears in \fBsharectl\fR(1M) as \fB1024\fR, is \fB1088\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBnetbios_scope\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the NetBIOS scope identifier, which identifies logical NetBIOS
networks that are on the same physical network. When you specify a NetBIOS
scope identifier, the server filters the number of machines that are listed in
the browser display to make it easier to find other hosts. The value is a text
string that represents a domain name. By default, no value is set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBpdc\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the preferred IP address for the domain controller. This property is
sometimes used when there are multiple domain controllers to indicate which one
is preferred. If the specified domain controller responds, it is chosen even if
the other domain controllers are also available. By default, no value is set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBrestrict_anonymous\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disables anonymous access to IPC$, which requires that the client be
authenticated to get access to MSRPC services through IPC$. A value of
\fBtrue\fR disables anonymous access to IPC$, while a value of \fBfalse\fR
enables anonymous access.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsigning_enabled\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables SMB signing. When signing is enabled but not required it is possible
for clients to connect regardless of whether or not the client supports SMB
signing. If a packet has been signed, the signature will be verified. If a
packet has not been signed it will be accepted without signature verification.
Valid values are \fBtrue\fR and \fBfalse\fR. The default value is \fBfalse\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsigning_required\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When SMB signing is required, all packets must be signed or they will be
rejected, and clients that do not support signing will be unable to connect to
the server. The \fBsigning_required\fR setting is only taken into account when
\fBsigning_enabled\fR is \fBtrue\fR. Valid values are \fBtrue\fR and
\fBfalse\fR. The default value is \fBfalse\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsystem_comment\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies an optional description for the system, which is a text string. This
property value might appear in various places, such as Network Neighborhood or
Network Places on Windows clients. By default, no value is set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBtraverse_mounts\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBtraverse_mounts\fR setting determines how the SMB server
presents sub-mounts underneath an SMB share.  When \fBtraverse_mounts\fR
is \fBtrue\fR (the default), sub-mounts are presented to SMB clients
like any other subdirectory.   When \fBtraverse_mounts\fR is \fBfalse\fR,
sub-mounts are not shown to SMB clients.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBunmap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The value is a command to be executed when disconnecting the share. The command
can take the same substitutions listed on the \fBmap\fR property.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwins_exclude\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies a comma-separated list of network interfaces that should not be
registered with WINS. NetBIOS host announcements are made on excluded
interfaces.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwins_server_1\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the IP address of the primary WINS server. By default, no value is
set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwins_server_2\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the IP address of the secondary WINS server. By default, no value is
set.
