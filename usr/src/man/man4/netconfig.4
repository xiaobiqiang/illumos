.SH NAME
netconfig \- network configuration database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/netconfig\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The network configuration database, \fB/etc/netconfig\fR, is a system file used
to store information about networks that are connected to the system. The
\fBnetconfig\fR database and the routines that access it (see
\fBgetnetconfig\fR(3NSL)) are part of the Network Selection component. The
Network Selection component also includes \fBgetnetpath\fR(3NSL) routines to
provide application-specific network search paths. These routines access the
\fBnetconfig\fR database based on the environment variable \fBNETPATH\fR. See
\fBenviron\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
\fBnetconfig\fR contains an entry for each network available on the system.
Entries are separated by newlines. Fields are separated by whitespace and occur
in the order in which they are described below. Whitespace can be embedded as
``\fB\e\fR\fIblank\fR'' or ``\fB\e\fR\fItab\fR''. Backslashes may be embedded
as ``\fB\e\e\fR\&''. Lines in \fB/etc/netconfig\fR that begin with a \fB#\fR
(hash) in column 1 are treated as comments.
.sp
.LP
Each of the valid lines in the \fBnetconfig\fR database correspond to an
available transport. Each entry is of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
network ID  semantics  flag  protocol-family \e
 protocol-name  network-device  translation-libraries
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fInetwork ID\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
A string used to uniquely identify a network. \fInetwork ID\fR consists of
non-null characters, and has a length of at least 1. No maximum length is
specified. This namespace is locally significant and the local system
administrator is the naming authority. All \fInetwork ID\fRs on a system must
be unique.

\fB\fIsemantics\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
The \fIsemantics\fR field is a string identifying the ``semantics'' of the
network, that is, the set of services it supports, by identifying the service
interface it provides. The \fIsemantics\fR field is mandatory. The following
semantics are recognized.

\fB\fIflag\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
The \fIflag\fR field records certain two-valued (``true'' and ``false'')
attributes of networks. \fIflag\fR is a string composed of a combination of
characters, each of which indicates the value of the corresponding attribute.
If the character is present, the attribute is ``true.'' If the character is
absent, the attribute is ``false.'' ``\fB-\fR'' indicates that none of the
attributes are present. Only one character is currently recognized:

\fB\fIprotocol family\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
The \fIprotocol family\fR and \fIprotocol name\fR fields are provided for
protocol-specific applications. The \fIprotocol family\fR field contains a
string that identifies a protocol family. The \fIprotocol family\fR identifier
follows the same rules as those for \fInetwork ID\fRs; the string consists of
non-null characters, it has a length of at least \fB1\fR, and there is no
maximum length specified. A ``\fB\(mi\fR\&'' in the \fIprotocol family\fR field
indicates that no protocol family identifier applies (the network is
experimental). The following are examples:

The \fIprotocol name\fR field contains a string that identifies a protocol. The
\fIprotocol name\fR identifier follows the same rules as those for \fInetwork
ID\fRs; that is, the string consists of non-NULL characters, it has a length of
at least \fB1\fR, and there is no maximum length specified. A ``\fB\(mi\fR\&''

\fB\fItranslation libraries\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
The \fIname-to-address translation libraries\fR support a ``directory service''
(a name-to-address mapping service) for the network. A ``\fB\(mi\fR\&'' in this
field indicates the absence of any \fItranslation libraries\fR. This has a
special meaning for networks of the protocol family \fBinet :\fR its
name-to-address mapping is provided by the name service switch based on the
entries for \fBhosts\fR and \fBservices\fR in \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(4). For
networks of other families, a ``\fB\(mi\fR\&'' indicates non-functional
name-to-address mapping. Otherwise, this field consists of a comma-separated
list of pathnames to dynamically linked libraries. The pathname of the library
can be either absolute or relative. See \fBdlopen\fR(3C).
