\fBspace\fR is an \fBASCII\fR file that gives information about disk space
requirements for the target environment. The \fBspace\fR file defines space
needed beyond what is used by objects defined in the \fBprototype\fR(4) file;
for example, files which will be installed with the \fBinstallf\fR(1M) command.
The \fBspace\fR file should define the maximum amount of additional space that
a package will require.
