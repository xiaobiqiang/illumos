.SH NAME
timezone \- default timezone data base
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/timezone\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The timezone file contains information regarding the default timezone for each
host in a domain. Alternatively, a single default line for the entire domain
may be specified. Each entry has the format:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fITimezone-name    official-host-or-domain-name\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or TAB characters. A `#'
indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the line are
not interpreted by routines which search the file. The timezone is a pathname
relative to the directory \fB/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo\fR.
.sp
.LP
This file is not actually referenced by any system software; it is merely used
as a source file to construct the \fBNIS\fR \fBtimezone.byname\fR map, which
was used by the installer in older releases of Solaris.
.sp
.LP
The \fBtimezone\fR file does not set the timezone environment variable
\fBTZ\fR. See \fBTIMEZONE\fR(4) for information to set the \fBTZ\fR environment
variable.
