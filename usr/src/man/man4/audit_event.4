.SH NAME
audit_event \- audit event definition and class mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/security/audit_event\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fB/etc/security/audit_event\fR is a user-configurable ASCII system file that
stores event definitions used in the audit system. As part of this definition,
each event is mapped to one or more of the audit classes defined in
\fBaudit_class\fR(4).
Programs can use the \fBgetauevent\fR(3BSM) routines to access audit
event information.
.sp
.LP
The fields for each event entry are separated by colons. Each event is
separated from the next by a NEWLINE.Each entry in the audit_event file has the
form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fInumber\fR:\fIname\fR:\fIdescription\fR:\fIflags\fR
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The fields are defined as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fInumber\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Event number.
.sp
Event number ranges are assigned as follows:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Reserved as an invalid event number.

Available for third party TCB applications.
.sp
System administrators must \fBnot\fR add, delete, or modify (except to change
the class mapping), events with an event number less than \fB32768\fR. These
events are reserved by the system.

.RS 15n
Flags specifying classes to which the event is mapped. Classes are comma
separated, without spaces.
.sp
Obsolete events are commonly assigned to the special class \fBno\fR (invalid)
to indicate they are no longer generated. Obsolete events are retained to
process old audit trail files. Other events which are not obsolete may also be
assigned to the \fBno\fR class.
