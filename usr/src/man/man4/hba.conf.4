.TH HBA.CONF 4 "Sep 4, 2003"
.SH NAME
hba.conf \- configuration file for the HBAAPI library
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/hba.conf\fR file is used to specify the Vendor-Specific Libraries
that are installed on the system. This file is used by the Common Library to
load the individual VSLs when \fBHBA_LoadLibrary\fR(3HBAAPI) is called. If
changes are made to the file while the library is in use, the library should be
freed and reloaded. A version 1 VSL is compatible only with a version 1 Common
Library. A version 2 VSL is compatible with both a version 1 and a version 2
Common Library.
.sp
.LP
Each VSL entry is a single line of the form:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
"name"	    "library path"
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIname\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
is the description of library. The library name should be prepended with the
domain of the manufacturer of the library.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIlibrary path\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 16n
is the absolute path to the shared object library file.

.SH BUGS
.sp
.LP
The HBAAPI is provided in both 32- and 64-bit versions, but only one
configuration file is specified. As a result, both 32- and 64-bit VSL libraries
must be specified within the same file. When using the 32-bit Common Library,
the 64-bit VSLs will fail to load. When using the 64-bit Common Library, the
32-bit VSLs will fail to load. These failures are silently ignored by the
Common Library during normal usage, but can result in warning messages when
running client applications in a debugger.
