.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/etc/mpapi.conf
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fB/etc/mpapi.conf\fR file is used to specify the vendor-provided plugin
library that is installed on the system. This file is used by the
\fBlibMPAPI\fR(3LIB) common library to load the individual plugin library when
its interface is called. If changes are made to the file while the library is
in use, the library should be unloaded and reloaded. Addition and removal of
the plugin library should be handled through \fBMP_RegisterPlugin\fR(3MPAPI)
and \fBMP_DeregisterPlugin\fR(3MPAPI).
.sp
.LP
Each plugin library entry is a single line of the form:
.sp

"id"        "library file name"
.fi
.in -2
