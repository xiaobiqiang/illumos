.SH NAME
nss \- configuration file for initgroups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/default/nss\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fB/etc/default/nss\fR configuration file provides methods for
\fBinitgroups\fR(3C) lookup method. The file also provides a method to disable
address sorting by name lookup functions. The file controls the behavior of the
name service switch routines outside of the source database mappings provided
by the \fB/etc/nsswitch.conf\fR file.
.sp
.LP
\fB/etc/default/nss\fR supports the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBNETID_AUTHORITATIVE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
Changes the behavior of the name service lookups to use the \fBnetid\fR table
in response to the \fBinitgroups()\fR call. By default,
\fBinitgroups()\fR uses the \fBgroup\fR table. When \fBNETID_AUTHORITATIVE\fR
is set to TRUE, \fBinitgroups()\fR uses \fBnetid\fR as the source for
supplementary groups rather than the \fBgroup\fR table.
.sp
The name service administrator must ensure that the \fBnetid\fR table contains
valid supplementary group information for users. Not all name services can
automatically keep the members listed in the \fBgroup\fR table in sync with the
\fBnetid\fR table.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBSORT_ADDRS\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 23n
If this option is set to FALSE, the sorting of addresses is disabled on
addresses that are returned by name lookup functions such as
\fBinitgroups()\fR, \fBgethostbyname\fR(3NSL), \fBnetdir_getbyname\fR(3NSL),
\fBgetaddrinfo\fR(3SOCKET), and \fBgetipnodebyname\fR(3SOCKET). Setting this
option to FALSE is useful when the order of addresses returned by the
nameserver needs to be maintained. To use the DNS round robin feature, for
example, address sorting by name lookup functions should be disabled.
.sp
By default, address sorting is enabled.
