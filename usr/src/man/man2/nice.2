.TH NICE 2 "Apr 1, 2004"
.SH NAME
nice \- change priority of a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>

\fBint\fR \fBnice\fR(\fBint\fR \fIincr\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBnice()\fR function allows a process to change its priority.  The
invoking  process must be in a scheduling class that supports the \fBnice()\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBnice()\fR function adds the value of  \fIincr\fR to the nice value of
the calling process. A process's nice value is a non-negative number for which
a greater positive value results in lower \fBCPU\fR priority.
.sp
.LP
A maximum nice value of (2 * \fBNZERO\fR) \(mi1 and a minimum nice value of 0
are imposed by the system. \fBNZERO\fR is defined in <\fBlimits.h\fR> with a
default value of 20. Requests for values above or below these limits result in
the nice value being set to the corresponding limit. A nice value of 40 is
treated as 39.
.sp
.LP
Calling the \fBnice()\fR function has no effect on the priority of processes or
threads with policy \fBSCHED_FIFO\fR or \fBSCHED_RR\fR.
.sp
.LP
Only a process with the {\fBPRIV_PROC_PRIOCNTL\fR} privilege can lower the nice
value.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBnice()\fR returns the new nice value minus
\fBNZERO\fR. Otherwise, \(mi1 is returned, the process's \fInice\fR value is
not changed, and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBnice()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fBnice()\fR function is called by a process in a scheduling class other
than time-sharing or fixed-priority.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIincr\fR argument is negative or greater than 40 and the
{\fBPRIV_PROC_PRIOCNTL\fR} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of
the calling process.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBpriocntl\fR(2) function is a more general interface to scheduler
functions.
.sp
.LP
Since \(mi1 is a permissible return value in a successful situation, an
application wishing to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to 0,
then call \fBnice()\fR, and if it returns \fB\(mi1\fR, check to see if
\fBerrno\fR is non-zero.
