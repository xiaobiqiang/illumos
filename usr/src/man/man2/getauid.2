.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBgetauid()\fR function returns the audit user \fBID\fR for the current
process. This value is initially set at login time and inherited by all child
processes. This value does not change when the real/effective user \fBIDs\fR
change, so it can be used to identify the logged-in user even when running a
setuid program. The audit user \fBID\fR governs audit decisions for a process.
.sp
.LP
The \fBsetauid()\fR function sets the audit user \fBID\fR for the current
process.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fBgetauid()\fR function returns the audit user
\fBID\fR of the current process on success. Otherwise, it returns \fB\(mi1\fR
and sets \fBerrno\fR to indicate the error.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion the \fBsetauid()\fR function returns \fB0\fR.
Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fBgetauid()\fR and \fBsetauid()\fR functions will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIauid\fR argument points to an invalid address.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEPERM\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The {\fBPRIV_SYS_AUDIT\fR} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of
the calling process.

Only a process with appropriate privileges can successfully execute these
calls.

.SH NOTES
.LP
These functions have been superseded by \fBgetaudit\fR(2) and \fBsetaudit()\fR.
