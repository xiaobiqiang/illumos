.TH PROCESSOR_INFO 2 "Jun 28, 2004"
.SH NAME
processor_info \- determine type and status of a processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/processor.h>

\fBint\fR \fBprocessor_info\fR(\fBprocessorid_t\fR \fIprocessorid\fR, \fBprocessor_info_t *\fR\fIinfop\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBprocessor_info()\fR function returns the status of the processor
specified by \fIprocessorid\fR in the \fBprocessor_info_t\fR structure pointed
to by \fIinfop\fR.
.sp
.LP
The structure \fBprocessor_info_t\fR contains the following members:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
int      pi_state;
char     pi_processor_type[PI_TYPELEN];
char     pi_fputypes[PI_FPUTYPE];
int      pi_clock;
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_state\fR member is the current state of the processor, either
\fBP_ONLINE\fR, \fBP_OFFLINE\fR, \fBP_NOINTR\fR, \fBP_FAULTED\fR,
\fBP_SPARE\fR, or \fBP_POWEROFF\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_processor_type\fR member is a null-terminated ASCII string specifying
the type of the processor.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_fputypes\fR member is a null-terminated ASCII string containing the
comma-separated types of floating-point units (FPUs) attached to the processor.
This string will be empty if no FPU is attached.
.sp
.LP
The \fBpi_clock\fR member is the processor clock frequency rounded to the
nearest megahertz. It may be  \fB0\fR if not known.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise,  \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned and  \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBprocessor_info()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
An non-existent processor \fBID\fR was specified.
.sp
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the
processor is not a member of the zone's pool's processor set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The  \fBprocessor_info_t\fR structure pointed to by  \fIinfop\fR was not
writable by the user.
