.TH SEMIDS 2 "Mar 8, 2000"
.SH NAME
semids \- discover all semaphore identifiers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/sem.h>

\fBint\fR \fBsemids\fR(\fBint *\fR\fIbuf\fR, \fBuint_t\fR \fInids\fR, \fBuint_t *\fR\fIpnids\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsemids()\fR function copies all active semaphore identifiers from the
system into the user-defined buffer specified by \fIbuf\fR, provided that the
number of such identifiers is not greater than the number of integers the
buffer can contain, as specified by \fInids\fR.  If the size of the buffer is
insufficient to contain all of the active semaphore identifiers in the system,
none are copied.
.sp
.LP
Whether or not the size of the buffer is sufficient to contain all of them, the
number of active semaphore identifiers in the system is copied into the
unsigned integer pointed to by \fIpnids\fR.
.sp
.LP
If \fInids\fR is 0 or less than the number of active semaphore identifiers in
the system, \fIbuf\fR is ignored.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBsemids()\fR returns \fB0\fR.  Otherwise,
\fB\(mi1\fR is returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The \fBsemids()\fR function will fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEFAULT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIbuf\fR or \fIpnids\fR argument points to an illegal address.
.RE

.SH USAGE
.sp
.LP
The \fBsemids()\fR function returns a snapshot of all the active semaphore
identifiers in the system.  More may be added and some may be removed before
they can be used by the caller.
