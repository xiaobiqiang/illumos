.SH NAME
mkdir, mkdirat \- make a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

\fBint\fR \fBmkdir\fR(\fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR, \fBmode_t\fR \fImode\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBmkdirat\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIpath\fR, \fBmode_t\fR \fImode\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBmkdir()\fR and \fBmkdirat()\fR functions create a new directory named by
the path name pointed to by \fIpath\fR. The mode of the new directory is
initialized from \fImode\fR (see \fBchmod\fR(2) for values of mode). The
protection part of the \fImode\fR argument is modified by the process's file
creation mask (see \fBumask\fR(2)).
.sp
.LP
The directory's owner \fBID\fR is set to the process's effective user ID. The
directory's group \fBID\fR is set to the process's effective group ID, or if
the \fBS_ISGID\fR bit is set in the parent directory, then the group \fBID\fR
of the directory is inherited from the parent.  The \fBS_ISGID\fR bit of the
new directory is inherited from the parent directory.
.sp
.LP
If \fIpath\fR names a symbolic link, \fBmkdir()\fR and \fBmkdirat()\fR fail and
set errno to \fBEEXIST\fR.
.sp
.LP
The newly created directory is empty with the exception of entries for itself
(\fB\&.\fR) and its parent directory (\fB\&..\fR).
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkdirat()\fR function behaves similarly to \fBmkdir()\fR; however, if
\fIpath\fR is a relative path, then the directory represented by \fBfd\fR is
used as the starting point for resolving \fIpath\fR. To use the processes
current working directory, \fIfd\fR may be set to the value \fBAT_FDCWD\fR.
.sp
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBmkdir()\fR and \fBmkdirat()\fR mark for update
the \fBst_atime\fR, \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the directory.
Also, the \fBst_ctime\fR and \fBst_mtime\fR fields of the directory that
contains the new entry are marked for update.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned. Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
returned, no directory is created, and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the
error.
