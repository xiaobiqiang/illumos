Current snapshot from freebsd revision 296191.

This is source tree snapshot of loader and related parts from
freebsd source.

Directory tree layout:

usr/src/boot is the root directory of the imported snapshot,
containing Makefile and licence notes for build and packaging.

Directories from freebsd userland (freebsd /usr/src tree):
include
lib

Directories from freebsd kernel tree, including boot loader itself
are located in sys subdirectory (freebsd /usr/src/sys tree):

platform specific include files:

sys/amd64
sys/i386
sys/x86

sys and ufs include files:
sys/sys
sys/ufs

zfs boot module import in freebsd:
sys/cddl 

boot loader sources are in:
sys/boot

Note, some of the directories are not 1:1 mapping in this source import,
because of differences of build systems used in illumos and freebsd.
Also some differences are due to fact, we do not need all the variants of
stage1/stage2 boot blocks which are built in freebsd due to the historical
or technical reasons.
