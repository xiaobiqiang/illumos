This directory builds a program linking all of the SMB server code
into a user-level process.  The result is not a fully functional
SMB server but is very useful for some kinds of development work.

The architecture of this roughly parallels the in-kernel version,
where the fksmbd program corresponds to the real smbd, the library
libfksmbsrv corresponds to the smbsrv kernel module, and all the
required kernel interfaces are simulated in libfakekernel.

Just as with the kernel code, there are mdb modules that know
how to walk data structures in libfksmbsrv, etc.

For debugging, etc. it's easiest to run this as a normal user,
i.e. yourself (not root); but before you can do that, there are
some prerequisites to take care of:

  a: Install ../bind-helper in /usr/lib/smbsrv/.
     It needs to be either setuid root (easiest) or added to
     the exec_attr as described in the top of bind-helper.c
     (This must be in /usr/lib/smbsrv, not the proto area.)

  b: Setup an SMB account for guest, i.e.
     Add pam_smb_passwd.so.1 to pam.conf if not already there
     (other password required pam_smb_passwd.so.1 nowarn)
     % useradd guest
     % smbadm enable-user guest
     % passwd guest    (sets the SMB p/w hash too)
     Make sure guest shows in /var/smb/smbpasswd

  c: chown/chmod the directories: /var/smb /var/run/smb
     to yourself, mode 755.  Reboot will chown these
     back to root, so repeat this after a reboot.

Now you can run fksmbd from the proto area using this script:
  ./Run.sh -df

You can also run it under dbx (see the .dbxrc file).
To run it under mdb (with mdb modules build here):
  mdb -L $ROOT/usr/lib/mdb/proc:/usr/lib/mdb/proc ...
where ... is one of: fksmbd, core.nnn, -p $PID

There are also some dtrace scripts in here, and in ../dtrace
for watching either all activity or only selected areas.
Run these like:  dtrace -s Watch-all.d -p $PID -o output

These two (from over in ../dtrace) also work with fksmbd:
	dtrace -s smbd-authsvc.d -p `pgrep fksmbd`  -o output
	dtrace -s smbd-pipesvc.d -p `pgrep fksmbd`  -o output


Here are a couple simple, handy tests you can try:

smbclient -L localhost -U guest%guest

smbclient //localhost/test -U guest%guest -c dir

smbtorture //localhost/test -U guest%guest base
