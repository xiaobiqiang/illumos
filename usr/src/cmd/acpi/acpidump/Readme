There is a bug in the interaction of acpidump and acpixtract when the table
size is greater than 1MB. The acpixtract code will stop parsing a table if
the first character on a line is not a space (' '). The acpidump code will
overflow the offset into the first character after 1MB. Until this is fixed
upstream, the following patch can be used against new versions of the acpi
source.
