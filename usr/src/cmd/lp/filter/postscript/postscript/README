Prologues and a few other PostScript files that are copied to /usr/lib/postscript
(ie. LIBDIR in ../Makefile) when you do an install.

Default settings have been moved to these files. All can be changed without
requiring a recompilation of any programs supplied with this package. In
addition all the translators understand the -P option that lets you pass
arbitrary PostScript through to the output file.  The option can be useful if
you want to change parameters that are defined in the prologue but not tied to
specific command line options.
