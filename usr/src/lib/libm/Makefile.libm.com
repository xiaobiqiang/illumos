# With studio CSTD of neither enabled nor disabled is "no_lib", whereby we
# expect C99-the-language, but don't modify the behaviour of library routines.
# This is VERY IMPORTANT, as $(CSTD_GNU99), for instance, would link us with
# values-xpg6, which would introduce an __xpg6 to our object with the C99
# flags set, causing us to default C99 libm behaviour on, breaking
# compatibility.
#
# We must then, unfortunately, defeat the GNU compiler _defaulting_ to C99, by
# in that case setting it back to gnu89, which _also_ accepts C99 syntax as
# far as is important.
