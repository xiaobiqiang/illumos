illumos gate README - Sep 16, 2012.

This is the illumos gate.  This is the illumos source tree.  It contains
the following subdirectories:

	usr/src	- 		The actual source code

	exception_lists	-	These are lists of exceptional cases
				used to limit noise during builds.
				Ideally this directory would consist of
				only empty files.

Integration Rules:

        All changes must have been reviewed, and approved by an advocate
	(below).  A code review may be performed by someone other than the
	advocate, but the final integration should still be approved by the
	advocate. 

        The advocate will want to see your webrev and hg outgoing -v.  The
	advocate will also ask about your testing, and may ask to see your
	build logs.

        All changes must adhere to typical ON style and quality rules.
        For example, pass full cstyle, applicable lint rules, etc.

        All new code must be licensed under CDDL, and modifications to existing
        code may not alter the original license terms.  Integrations of code
        from upstream sources that use another liberal open source license are
        permissible, subject to approval of the advocates or developer council.
        Exceptions to this policy shall require the approval of the developer
        council.

        Commits should have comments of the following form:
